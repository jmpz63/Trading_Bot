# üõ°Ô∏è Professional Risk & Money Management Framework

## üéØ Core Risk Management Principles (Day & Swing Trading)

### **Position Sizing Methodologies**
```python
class AdvancedPositionSizing:
    def kelly_criterion(self, win_rate, avg_win, avg_loss):
        # Optimal position size calculation
        # Risk of ruin minimization
        # Capital growth optimization
        
    def volatility_based_sizing(self, symbol_volatility, portfolio_vol_target):
        # Adjust position size based on asset volatility
        # Maintain consistent portfolio risk
        # Scale positions inversely to volatility
        
    def fixed_fractional_method(self, account_equity, risk_per_trade=0.02):
        # Conservative approach: 1-2% risk per trade
        # Compound growth protection
        # Drawdown limitation
```

### **Multi-Market Risk Controls**
- **Forex Markets**: Currency pair correlation limits
- **Futures Markets**: Margin requirements, overnight risks
- **Stock Markets**: Sector concentration limits, gap risks
- **Cross-Market**: Total portfolio exposure limits

### **Advanced Risk Metrics**
```python
def professional_risk_metrics(self):
    # Value at Risk (VaR) - daily, weekly, monthly
    # Conditional VaR (Expected Shortfall)  
    # Maximum Drawdown controls
    # Sharpe ratio optimization
    # Sortino ratio (downside deviation focus)
    # Calmar ratio (return/max drawdown)
```

## üöÄ APM Risk Management Enhancement

### **Phase 1: Dynamic Position Sizing**
```python
class DynamicRiskManager:
    def __init__(self, account_size, max_risk_per_trade=0.02):
        self.account_size = account_size
        self.max_risk = max_risk_per_trade
        
    def calculate_position_size(self, entry_price, stop_loss, symbol_volatility):
        # Account for volatility
        # Respect maximum risk limits  
        # Optimize for risk-adjusted returns
```

### **Phase 2: Portfolio Heat Management**
```python
def portfolio_heat_control(self):
    # Total open position risk: Max 6-8%
    # Correlated position limits: Max 4%
    # Single position limit: Max 2%
    # Emergency stop: Close all at 10% drawdown
```

### **Phase 3: Performance Attribution**
```python
def risk_adjusted_performance(self):
    # Strategy-level risk metrics
    # Asset class risk contribution
    # Time-based risk analysis
    # Risk-adjusted return optimization
```
