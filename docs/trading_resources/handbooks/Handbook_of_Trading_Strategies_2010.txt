ABSTRACT
Various measures of liquidity are estimated for common and preferred
shares (individual ﬁrms and exchange-traded funds), units (trusts and
limited partnerships), notes (index linked and principal protected), and
warrants listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. We document signiﬁcant
differences in potential and actual trade execution costs intra- and intersecurity type and across time that impact on the net beneﬁts of trading
for different levels of trading patience, the valuation discounts of nongranular portfolios under various more or less patient exit strategies, and
the likely performance drag from investments in different security types
or the average security in that security type. We also provide an illustration of how trade execution costs are affected adversely by worries of a
global recession.

INTRODUCTION
Since the performance of all investment decisions are directly affected by
the quality of effecting such decisions in the marketplace and varies within
and across security types, all investors must carefully balance the marginal
beneﬁts and costs of each transaction. Such costs include commissions, fees,
execution, and opportunity costs. Execution quality reﬂects various trading
demands for immediate liquidity (speed) based on different investment
styles and on the availability and cost of such liquidity at each point in time.
The latter includes the expected and actual impact of investor trade on
market prices and on the cost and likelihood of concluding the remainder of
a trade. Since execution quality is most often unobservable, it is imputed
from the data either as the difference between the actual trade execution
price and the price that would have existed in the absence of the trade or as
the difference (referred to as performance leakage) between the quoted or
actual trade price and its counterpart in the absence of trade costs (referred
to as the “fair” price). The time to complete a trade for a ﬁxed concession
from the “fair” price is another dimension of execution quality, which can
not be measured using most available databases (such as the one used
herein) that do not provide information on order submissions and their subsequent ﬁll history. Execution quality also affects the pricing of securities
through its impact on value discounts.
Trade activity measures of liquidity include (un)signed number and dollar value of shares traded and the number of trades. Metrics for measuring
expected or actual trade execution costs include quoted, effective and realized spreads, and quoted depths. Hasbrouck (2009) provides a good review
of various measures of trade and market impact costs using daily data.
Earlier research focuses on the measurement of execution cost (e.g.,
Collins and Fabozzi, 1991), on the impact of execution costs on the speed
and method by which institutional investors should implement buy and sell
decisions (e.g., Bodurtha and Quinn, 1990; Wagner and Edwards, 1993;
Wilcox, 1993), and on trading costs in different international markets (e.g.,
Kothare and Laux, 1995). More recent studies examine the effects of
changes in exchange rules on execution costs across trading platforms (e.g.,
Venkataraman, 2001; SEC, 2001; Bessembinder, 2003; Boehmer, 2005) and
on institutional differences (Eleswarapu and Venkataraman, 2006).
To our knowledge, few published studies examine the trade execution cost
performance of security types other than stocks, bonds, and highly liquid

c h a p t e r 1 P e r f o r m a n c e L e a k a g e a n d Va l u e D i s c o u n t s

derivatives. This study is the ﬁrst to examine trade execution costs for all the
security types on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). We expect to ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in execution costs for a dichotomization of trades by
security type.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. The second section of
this chapter discusses the sample and data. This chapter’s third section presents
the measures of market quality. The fourth section presents the empirical
estimates of market quality; and the ﬁfth section concludes the chapter.

SAMPLE AND DATA
Our initial sample contains all 2,300 listed securities on the TSX for the
ﬁrst two calendar months of 2008; namely, 1,300 common shares, 15 shares
listed in USD, 256 preferred shares, 396 units including income trusts
units, 149 debentures, 1 119 warrants, and 65 NT_NO notes including
asset-linked, principal protected notes sponsored by the Royal Bank.2 As is
common practice in the literature and reporting in the ﬁnancial press (e.g.,
Globe and Mail ) and following the deﬁnition of the SEC regarding penny
shares available at http://www.sec.gov/answers/penny.htm, the common
share sample is split in two based on those trading at or above $5 per share
(Common $5) and those trading at less that $5 per share (Common $5)
based on the time-series mean price of each common share.
Trading data are extracted from the TSX’s Trades and Quotes (TAQ)
database. As in Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2001), the data are
cleaned by removing: (i) quotes/trades outside regular trading hours of 9:30
to 16:00 EST; (ii) trades with negative numbers of shares or trading prices;
(iii) trades with delayed delivery, special settlement and/or delivery, or subject to special restrictions and conditions; (iv) bids exceeding offers or either
with nil prices or volumes; and (v) quoted percentage spreads exceeding
30 percent.3 These ﬁlters delete 2.74 percent and 5.41 percent of the initial
202,710,358 quotes and 27,276,955 trades, respectively.

MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE LEAKAGE
AND VALUE DISCOUNTS
Our ﬁrst measure is the quoted spread, QSi,t , for security i at time t or
QSi,t  (Aski,t  Bidi,t) / [0.5(Aski,t  Bidi,t)], where the denominator is the
midspread. Our second measure is superior to the ﬁrst for a patient investor

5

6

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

given that limit orders can improve on the posted quotes of registered traders on the TSX. Thus, the effective spread, ESi,tk, is given by ESi,t  2 
[(Pricei,t  MidSpread Prei,t)/MidSpread Prei,t]  Ii,t where Ii,t is a trade indicator variable equal to 1 for buyer initiated (purchase) trades and 1 for
seller initiated (sale) trades. Since benchmark quotes need to be observed
when the trade decision is made and these times are not observable and
quotes may move after submitting even small orders, a ﬁve-second lag is
used to determine the pretrade benchmark midspread as recommended by
Bessembinder (2003).
Since the identity of the trade initiator is unobservable empirically, the
Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm is used to sign the transactions. The trade
is assumed to be buyer- (seller-) initiated when the traded price is higher
(lower) than the prevailing midquote or if the last nonzero price change
(tick) is positive (negative) for trade prices at the prevailing midquote (tick
rule). Contemporaneous quotes (i.e., quotes for a zero-second lag) are used
to compute benchmark midquotes for trade signing purposes (Ellis,
Michaely, and O’Hara, 2000; Bessembinder, 2003).
Effective spreads are compensation for both the probability of adverse
information and order execution. The former represents the loss incurred
by market makers to better informed traders as prices move against the
market makers. The realized spread is not only a better measure of compensation for trade execution but a better indicator of market liquidity and
trading quality from the market-maker’s perspective. To estimate the realized spread and thus eliminate the loss to better informed traders, the trading price is compared with a benchmark or a midquote that occurs
sometime after the trading takes place. This measures the market-maker’s
proﬁt if she or he rebalances inventory after making the initial trade. As in
Huang and Stoll (1996) and Bessembinder (2003), benchmark quotes for
both k  5 and 30 minutes after trades (i.e., MidSpreadPosti,t,k) are used
herein. Daily closing quotes are used for trades occurring within the last
k  5 or 30 minutes of a trading session. The realized spread, RSi,t,k , is
given by: RSi,t,k  2  [(Pricei,t  MidSpreadPosti,t,k)/MidSpread Prei,t]  Ii,t.
Thus, the price impact of a trade, PIi,t,k, is given by the difference between
the effective spread and the realized spread, ESi,t  RSi,t,k , or PIi,t,k  2 
[(MidSpreadPosti,t,k  MidSpreadPosti,t,k)/MidSpread Prei,t]  Ii,t.
Since the effective/realized spreads or price impact can be negative
due to the measurement of the trade sign variable at a different time

c h a p t e r 1 P e r f o r m a n c e L e a k a g e a n d Va l u e D i s c o u n t s

compared with the prevailing or subsequent quote, we also use an alternative for these spread measures that relies on their absolute values. For
instance, the alternative measure of the effective spread, AES i,t , is: AESi,t
 2  |(Pricei,t  MidSpread Prei,t)/MidSpread Prei,t|.
The quoted dollar depth, which is the capacity of a market to absorb
trades with little or no price impact, also is measured to assess liquidity
and market execution quality. As quotes represent prices at which market
makers are willing to trade at a prespeciﬁed maximum trading size, we
assume that this size is the highest possible volume before an order eats
up the available liquidity at the inside quotes and quotes need to be moved
up or down depending on trade direction. We measure depth QDi,t, as the
average quoted order ﬂow size at both the inside bid and ask or QDi,t, 
0.5 (Bidi,t  BidSizei,t  Aski,t  AskSizei,t).

EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES FOR THE TSX
The relative quoted and effective spreads for all the securities listed on
the TSX and seven subsamples differentiated by security type (and price
in the case of common shares) are reported in Table 1.1. As expected, the
lowest median spreads are for common shares with prices above $5 (Common $5), followed by the asset-linked notes (NT_NO) for relative
quoted spreads (QS) and preferred shares for the two measures of relative
and average effective spreads (ES and AES). The highest median spreads
are for Warrants. To illustrate, the median effective spreads are 0.31 percent and 6.88 percent for Common with prices above $5 and Warrants,
respectively.
NT_NO and Common $5 are among the two lowest mean spreads
with Common $5 only occupying the lowest mean spread for the ES
measure. Warrants have the highest mean spreads for each of the three
measures. The relatively high trading costs associated with Warrants is
primarily due to the relatively low traded prices of Warrants (mean of
$1.79 compared with $13.24 for all other securities). Securities denominated in USD have the second highest mean and median spreads for
all three measures. To illustrate, the median USD effective spread is
4.19 percent.
As expected, considerable variation exists in the spread measures within
each security type. The NT_NO followed by Common $5 have the lowest

variation (e.g., effective spread sigmas of 0.76 percent and 1.22 percent,
respectively). Warrants and USD have the highest variations for all three
spread measures with USD in the top spot only for QS (6.89 percent).
As expected, the spread distributions are right-skewed so that the medians are
always lower than their mean counterparts. While a small percentage of the
effective spreads using the signing algorithm are negative, as expected due to
signing error, this is not the case when the alternate measure of the effective
spread AES is calculated.

A comparison of the mean, median, and sigma values for common shares
trading below and above $5 exempliﬁes the much higher trade costs associated
with so-called “penny” stocks (e.g., median ES of 2.31 percent versus
0.31 percent and sigma of 4.16 percent versus 1.22 percent, respectively). This
may have implications for small cap investing in national markets smaller than
in the United States.

NT_NO), the means are greater than their median counterparts, which
indicates right-skewed distributions. The median relative realized spreads
are lowest for Common $5 followed by Preferreds for all but the
ARS30 (Alteranative Realized Spread based on quotes 30 minutes after
trades) measure where the lowest median is for Preferreds followed by
NT_NO. To illustrate, the median RS5 and RS30 values are 0.43 percent and 0.41 percent, respectively, for Common $5. The highest
median relative realized spreads are for Warrants. This is followed by
Common $5 for RS5 and by USD for the other three relative realized
spread measures.
The lowest mean RS5 and RS30 are for USD and NT_NO, respectively,
followed by respectively NT_NO and Common $5. In contrast, the lowest mean ARS5 and ARS30 are for Preferreds followed by Common $5
and NT_NO, respectively. Warrants always have the highest mean relative
realized spreads followed by Common $5 for RS5 and RS30 and by USD
for ARS5 and ARS30, respectively. Thus, the choice of how to calculate the
relative realized spread has an impact on the rankings of this measure
across security types.
The lowest sigmas are found for NT_NO for all four relative realized
spread measures, followed by units for RS5 and Common $5 for the
other three measures. Once again, Warrants have the highest relative realized spreads followed by USD for the two 5-minute measures and Common $5 for the two 30-minute measures. To illustrate, the sigmas for
RS5 and RS30 for Warrants are 8.42 percent and 9.41 percent, respectively.
The quoted depth-traded volumes (share numbers and dollars) and the
number of trades for the various samples are reported in Table 1.3. All the
distributions are right-skewed. The lowest mean, median, and sigma of
quoted depth (QD), share volume (Shares vol) and number of trades are for
Warrants, NT_NO, and NT_NO, respectively. With two exceptions, the
highest mean, median, and sigma of these three measures are for Common
$5. The exceptions are NT_NO for the median QD and Common $5
for the median Shares vol.
The high depth for the index linked notes shows that dealers have minimal concerns about trading against informed traders as private information
is negligible about the entire index compared with individual securities. The
high median of penny stock trading volume measured in number of shares
is due to the larger round lot sizes of stocks trading below $1 and the need
to trade more shares of a lower priced share to achieve a comparable dollar

volume as for non-penny shares.4 Despite their high depths and low trading
costs compared with other security types, the notes offered by the Royal
Bank are not heavily traded as the exchange-traded funds are more popular
instruments. Units are the second most actively traded security type on the
TSX. The income trust vehicle, which passes through its income untaxed,
was a popular investment choice due to yields considerably higher than
those on ﬁxed income securities (Kryzanowski and Lu, 2009).
All of the nonparametric (distribution-free) Kruskal-Wallis tests of the
equality of the medians as well as the ANOVA tests of equality of means
across the seven security types for each of the 11 liquidity measures are
signiﬁcant at better than the 0.001 level. Based on tests of the means and
medians for all pairs of security types for each of the 11 liquidity measures,
as summarized in Table 1.4 (further details available from the authors), we
ﬁnd the following to be signiﬁcant at better than the 0.05 level: (i) all pairings of Common $5 with Common $5 and with Preferreds; (ii) all but
one of the pairings of Common $5 or Common $5 with Units (i.e.,
median Nb_trades for Common $5) and with Warrants (i.e., mean QD
for Common $5); and (iii) all but one of the pairings of Warrants with
Preferreds (i.e., mean and median Nb_trades), with Units (mean Share vol)
and with NT_NO (mean $ Vol).
Although comparisons across markets (and especially for different time
periods) are only indicative due to interexchange differences in design
features (e.g., tick and board lot sizes, order handling rules, and regulatory rules and their enforcement), Warrants on the TSX have higher
mean relative quoted spreads (13.086 percent versus 7.308 percent) and
lower quoted dollar depths (4,445 CAD versus 171,990 HKD) based on
the values reported for company warrants by Brockman and Chung
(2007) for Hong Kong for the period of May 1996 to August 1997. As
expected, the relative quoted and effective spreads for TSX Common
$5 are inferior to the cross-sectional statistics for time-series means
reported by Roll (2005) for NYSE-listed securities. The mean, median,
and sigma for the TSX (NYSE) are 1.82 percent (1.60 percent), 0.97 percent (1.15 percent), and 2.09 percent (1.36 percent) for relative quoted
spreads, and are 1.82 percent (1.11 percent), 0.84 percent (0.77 percent)
and 1.34 percent (1.32 percent) for the alternative relative effective
spreads. Not surprisingly, the mean relative quoted and effective spreads
of 1.82 percent and 1.34 percent are considerably higher than their
respective counterparts of 0.54 percent and 0.50 percent for the TSX and

Table 1.4 Tests of Pairwise Means and Medians for the Various Liquidity Measures
Table 1.4 reports the liquidity measures with p values  0.05 for tests of pairwise means and medians, which are reported in the lower and upper diagonals,
respectively. Thus, they are not reported (such as between Common $5 and Common $5) if they are signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level. They are underlined if
the pairwise differences are signiﬁcant at the 0.10 level.

considerably lower than their respective counterparts of 2.32 percent
and 2.13 percent for the average exchange, which are reported by Jain
(2003) based on closing daily values for the 25 highest market capitalization stocks for each of 51 major exchanges for the first four months

Time-series plots of six of the liquidity measures for the various samples
are depicted in Figures 1.1 to 1.6. We examine the intertemporal variation
in these series using the standard deviation (sigma) and coefﬁcient of variation (i.e., the sigma divided by the mean).
Based on untabulated results, the three security types with the highest
spread sigmas are Warrants followed by USD and NT_NO for QS and an
interchange of Warrants and NT_NO for ES and RS30. The three security
types with the highest spread Coefﬁcients of Variation (CVs) are NT_NO

NT_NO has relatively low spreads and high quoted depths compared with
the other security types, it has relatively lower trade-activity measures of
liquidity and relatively higher intertemporal variation for all six liquidity
measures.

The behavior of the six liquidity measures in Figures 1.1 to 1.6 around
Monday, January 21, 2008 is interesting. Just prior to and on this date,
world equity markets were affected adversely due to worries of a global
recession. There was an upward spike in relative spreads (quoted and
effective and especially for Warrants), and an upward spike in dollar
traded volume.

CONCLUSION
This chapter makes four major contributions to the literature and practice. First, this study provides estimates of various measures of trade
execution quality that investors must seriously consider when deciding to
ef fect investment decisions, and documents signif icant dif ferences
in potential and actual trade execution costs as measured by various market qualit y measures intra- and inter-securit y t ype and across time
(intertemporally). This information should be of considerable interest to
investors (especially technical traders) who must carefully balance the
marginal beneﬁts and costs of each transaction. Second, this study provides estimates of the magnitudes of the discounts required when valuing
various securit y t ypes under a hold scenario and under less and more
patient liquidation scenarios. This information should be of considerable
interest to asset valuators and to investors when assessing the value of
mutual funds with concentrated or nongranular portfolios under various
exit strategies for speciﬁc security holdings. Third, this study provides
estimates of the discounts required when assessing reported portfolio
performance. This performance-drag information should be of considerable interest to investors in all funds that actively trade, and particularly
in those funds with aggressive and nongranular holdings and limited liquidity provisions under down-market scenarios. Fourth, this study documents how trade execution costs vary on a daily basis and how they are
affected adversely by worries of a global recession (i.e., prior to and on
Monday, January 21, 2008).

Informed Trading
in Parallel Auction
and Dealer Markets
The Case of the London Stock Exchange
Pankaj K. Jain, Christine Jiang, Thomas H. McInish,
and Nareerat Taechapiroontong

ABSTRACT
In this chapter, we examine trading on the London Stock Exchange where
the same stocks trade side-by-side on the computer-based Stock Exchange
Electronic Trading Service (SETS) and the dealer market (DM). SETS has
more trades overall, but the DM has larger trades and dominates the execution of very large-sized trades. The permanent price impact of trades is
much larger on SETS than on the DM. However, the temporary price
impact of trades is signiﬁcantly larger on the DM than on SETS. The two
effects together indicate that informed trades are likely routed to SETS for
immediate execution, whereas informed trades are screened or trade prices
are appropriately negotiated ex-ante to reﬂect information in the DM.

INTRODUCTION
We study trading on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) where, unlike
most other exchanges, the same stocks trade on the computer-based Stock
Exchange Electronic Trading Service (SETS) and the dealer market (DM).

SETS is the fully computerized automated trading system where liquidity
is provided by traders who submit limit orders. The purpose of our chapter
is to analyze informed order ﬂows and price impact of trades in this parallel
market structure.
At the time of our study, dealers had no afﬁrmative obligation to offer
quotes. Yet, the DM accounts for a signiﬁcant share of trading volume.
Dealers can also provide liquidity on SETS. There is no requirement for
formal interaction between SETS and the DM. Yet SETS and DM are very
closely integrated and may often have the same dealer serving as counterparty. Nevertheless, there are several important distinctions between the
two systems in terms of anonymity and direct agency crosses. The hybrid
structure of the LSE has not yet been examined in the context of informed
trading, although other st udies analyze the interaction of order f low
between the two markets (see Friederich and Payne, 2007) and the dynamics of the market open and close (see Ellul, Shin, and Tonks, 2005).
We provide a number of ﬁndings. Both the SETS and the DM are active
with the SETS market executing more trades, but the DM executing larger
trades overall and dominating the execution of very large trades. The permanent price impact of trades is not only signiﬁcantly lower on the DM
than on SETS, but is actually negative. However, the temporary price
impact of trades is signiﬁcantly larger on the DM than on SETS. The two
results together suggest that dealers on the DM are able to effectively identify informed trades ex-ante. Such identiﬁcation of trade motives enables
dealers to either screen out the informed trades avoiding losses or trade
effectively with them, and in the process learning the information with
which they can trade proﬁtably for their own accounts, as suggested by
Naik, Neuberger, and Viswanathan (1999).

TRADING SYSTEMS AND VENUES
Competing yet Complementary Trading Systems
Madhavan (1995) proposes a model that provides a rationale for the existence of fragmented markets, focusing on the impact of disclosing trading
information to market participants. He shows that informed traders and
large traders who place multiple trades obtain lower expected trading costs
in fragmented markets where their trades are not disclosed. On the other
hand, dealers beneﬁt from nondisclosure by decreasing price competition.

c h a p t e r 2 I n f o r m e d T r a d i n g i n Pa r a l l e l m a r k e t s

Contrary to this view, Chowdhry and Nanda (1991) provide a theoretical
model in which if more than one market for a security exists, one market
will emerge as the dominant market, a “winner takes most” phenomenon.
This prediction occurs as liquidity traders seek thick markets with the lowest execution costs and informed traders maximize their proﬁts by hiding
trades in the most liquid markets. Glosten (1994) suggests that the open
electronic limit order book such as SETS is inevitable because it provides as
much liquidity as possible in extreme situations and does not invite competition from third market dealers, while other trading institutions do.
Our empirical analysis presented later is consistent with the coexistence
hypothesis instead of the market dominance hypothesis.

Permanent Price Impact in Coexisting Markets
Another branch of literature allows for coexistence and deals with either
upstairs versus downstairs markets or auction versus dealer markets. Seppi
(1990), Easley and O’Hara (1987), and Easley, Kiefer, and O’Hara (1996)
developed models in which dealers (such as upstairs block traders in
New York or the dealers in London) are able to differentiate uninformed
traders from informed traders based on reputation signals or other implicit
commitments. This non-anonymous feature in dealer markets enables
ex-ante identiﬁcation, relationship based information sharing as suggested
by Hansch, Naik, and Viswanathan (1999), or potential cream skimming of
uninformed trades and screening out of informed traders. This ability of
the dealers lowers adverse selection costs for large liquidity traders. Seppi
(1990) argues that the lack of anonymity in off-exchange block trading
enables investors and the dealers to make “no bagging the street” commitments and face penalties on any subsequent trades if they fail to divulge
information.
Grossman (1992), Pagano and Roell (1996), and Schwartz and Steil
(1996) focus on order transparency in limit order books like SETS. They
suggest that many large traders do not want to expose their orders to the
public since large trades may adversely impact the market price, may invite
front running by other traders, and may introduce a free-option problem
(the risk of being picked off if market conditions change). A large order sent
to the DM is less exposed than one sent to the SETS market and may be
matched with other unexpressed liquidity. As a consequence, dealers serve
as a repository of information on large investors’ latent trading interest.

25

Premiums paid to the dealers by informed traders are justiﬁed if they are
less than costs of marching up or down the order book to execute large
quantities. We examine these predictions of the theoretical models in out
univariate analysis of the unique hybrid LSE market structure. Additionally,
Franke and Hess (2000) propose that the information differential between
an anonymous screen-based trading system and a non-anonymous ﬂoor
trading system should increase the attractiveness of the latter in the times of
high information intensity (proxies for information intensity include trading
volume and price volatility). We study these ideas in our cross-sectional
regression.
A few country speciﬁc empirical studies are closely related to ours.
Heidle and Huang (2002) investigate whether auction markets (NYSE,
AMEX) or dealer markets (NASDAQ) are better able to identify informed
traders. Gramming, Schiereck, and Theissen (2001) examine the relation of
degree of trader anonymity and the probability of informed trading on the
two parallel markets at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Booth et al. (2002)
and Smith, Turnbull, and White (2001) ﬁnd that upstairs trades have a
lower permanent price impact than those executed downstairs in Helsinki
and Toronto, respectively. Our chapter extends the analysis to the hybrid
LSE market and also analyzes both permanent and temporar y price
impacts. The former unveils the informativeness of trades, whereas the
latter represents the transaction cost for investors.

Temporary Price Impact in Auction and
Dealer Markets
As addressed in Seppi (1990) and Grossman (1992), off-exchange dealer
markets involve a process of searching and matching of order ﬂow. Temporary price concessions are needed to induce dealers to accommodate orders
due to inventory holding risk. On the other hand, SETS is fully automated
implying that additional liquidit y cannot be negotiated by the offer of
price concessions. Hence, trade sizes and temporary price impacts should
be larger for an off-exchange DM than for an anonymous SETS market.
In addition, for small sizes, dealers may not offer signiﬁcant price improvement because of less intensive competition. For large orders, dealers have
the ability to extract additional information about the motivation behind
the order ﬂow and beneﬁt from such reputation effects, and signiﬁcant
price improvements are often achieved as a result. Thus, temporary price

c h a p t e r 2 I n f o r m e d T r a d i n g i n Pa r a l l e l m a r k e t s

impact is a decreasing function of trade size for orders on the DM market.
Bernhardt et al. (2005) also develop a model along these lines where larger
orders have lower transaction costs on the LSE.

INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND, DATA,
AND METHODOLOGY
The London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange, which is one of world’s leading stock exchanges,
has experienced signiﬁcant transformation to maintain and compete for order
ﬂow and to improve price discovery. Before October 1997, the LSE was a
pure quote-driven dealer market (Stock Exchange Automated Quotation,
SEAQ) with relatively nontransparent order ﬂow. Retail investors complained
that they were subsidizing large traders, which caused order ﬂow to migrate to
other European markets.
In 1997, the LSE began to implement a phased introduction of a more
transparent order-driven auction market called the Stock Exchange Electronic Trading System. At ﬁrst, SETS traded stocks in the FTSE 100
index, but over time the stocks covered increased and in 2003 roughly 217
stocks from the FTSE 250 index were traded. Thin stocks that have never
been components of these two indices are traded only on an old quotedriven market (SEAQ) and are not included in our study.1
Dealers on the LSE can compete voluntarily for trades on SETS’ stocks
on an off-exchange DM, but are no longer obliged to post ﬁrm bid and ask
prices as they did earlier, and their quotes are no longer available to investors
through a publicly available price-display mechanism. Trades on the DM are
not constrained by limit order prices on SETS or required to be partially
executed against the limit order book. This arrangement differs from other
hybrid markets such as the NYSE, Toronto Stock Exchange, Paris Bourse,
or Helsinki Stock Exchange where the public orders in the limit order take
priority over specialist market maker’s own trades. Investors can choose
their trading venues depending on their motivation. Investors, who require
prompt and anonymous transactions, may prefer to execute market orders
against the book in SETS. Passive customers may choose to place limit
orders on the book. Large traders, who do not want their trades to create
extensive impact on prices in an order book market, may prefer to trade offbook on the DM. For additional institutional details about the LSE, see
Board and Wells (2001) and Friederich and Payne (2007).

Data Selection and Processing
This study uses data provided by the London Stock Exchange for stocks
that are components of either the FTSE 100 or FTSE 250 indices in 2000,
designated as SET1 or SET2. These stocks are traded on both the SETS
and the DM. We include only trades during normal hours (08:00 to 16:30).
All trades are in GBP.
These data comprise a number of files. For each trade, the Trade
Reports File has the ﬁrm symbol, date, time, price, number of shares,
whether the trade is buyer or seller initiated, which market was used for the
trade (SETS or DM), type of order (market, limit), special designations
(such as ﬁll or kill), and the settlement date. We note that in determining
trade direction on the DM we take the viewpoint of a trader. We exclude
trades with settlement dates greater than SETS’ standard settlement
date, trades with a price or volume of zero, and trades with size greater
than 8 NMS and trades designated “WT” (which are *8 NMS and are subject to a Work Principal Agreement), “UT” (occurring during opening and
closing call period), “RO” (resulting from an option exercise), “SW”
(resulting from a stock swap), “CT” (contra trades), and “PN” (work principal portfolio notiﬁcation). We also exclude trades for which the quantity
|( pt  pt1) /pt1|0.5 where pt is the trade price at time t, as this condition
might result from potential data entry errors.
All quote data are from SETS. The DM does not provide quote data.
The Best Prices File includes the time and price (but not the depth) of all
quote updates that are better than an existing bid or ask on SETS. We
exclude quotes with either ask, bid, ask size, or bid size less than or equal to
zero, and for which |(atat1)/at1|0.5 or |(btbt1)/bt1|0.5, where at
is the ask quote and bt is the bid quote.
For all orders submitted to SETS, the Order History File contains
details about the date and time when the order is entered, deleted, cancelled, or executed, along with its order type, quantity, and limit price. We
use these details to obtain aggregate depth at each best limit price.
Due to mergers, new listings, and delistings, stocks leave and join the
index during the year and to ensure a sufﬁcient sample period, we use only
stocks that are members of either index for at least 80 days during the year
2000. The ﬁnal sample comprises 177 ﬁrms after deleting 16 stocks not
meeting the requirements enumerated above. The average market capitalization for these ﬁrms, obtained from the Compustat global ﬁle, is 7.5 billion pounds and the average stock price is 6.59 pounds.

Measurement of Price Impact
To measure whether there is a difference in how trades affect prices on
SETS and the DM, we use the method of Keim and Madhavan (1996) and
Booth et al. (2002). This method uses trade prices rather than quotes,
which is helpful because we do not have quotes for the DM. The total price
impact can be decomposed into the permanent price impact and the temporary price impact. The permanent price impact reﬂects changes in beliefs
about a security’s value due to new information conveyed by trades.2 The
temporary price impact measures liquidity effects from transitory price
reversals. The total price impact reﬂects the difference between the trade
price required to absorb the order and the preceding price.
We assume that a trade occurs at time t with price PT. The equilibrium
price observed at time t  b before trade at time t is PB and the equilibrium
price observed at time t  a after trade at time t is PA. The sequence of
trades is b t a. We measure price impact as
Permanent price impact (%)  BS  ln (PA /PB)  100

(2.1)

Temporary price impact (%)  BS  ln (PT / PA)  100

(2.2)

Total price impact (%)  BS  ln (PT / PB)  100

(2.3)

where BS equals plus (minus) 1 for buyer (seller) initiated trades. We also
study differences in price impact by trade size. We categorize trades by percentiles of all trades for each ﬁrm. This ensures a representation of all
stocks in each trade size category rather than bunching of trades from a
stock in one category. Note that the trade size cut-off varies from ﬁrm to
ﬁrm. To identify the equilibrium prices before and after a trade, we plot the
price movement around large GBP trades (top 5 percent in terms of GBP)
in Figure 2.1. We calculate cumulative returns as follows. Each trade is
labeled as trade 0, in turn. The previous 20 trades (regardless of trade location, size, buy/sell) executed prior to trade 0 (1, 2, . . .,20) and 20
trades executed after trades 0 (1, 2, . . ., 20) are obtained. Then tradeto-trade returns calculated as the difference in log prices are estimated
from each trade from trade 20 to trade 20. These returns are averaged
and cumulated.
We identify the 5 percent of trades that have the greatest GBP value. We
label each of these trades, in turn, as trade 0. For each trade 0, we identify
the 20 previous trades, trades 1 through 21, and the subsequent 21

trades, trades 1 through 21. We calculate the return for each trade
from 20 to 20 as the difference in the log of the trade price minus the
log of the previous trade price. These returns are averaged and cumulated
beginning with trade 20. Mean values of cumulative average returns are
plotted. Percentage cumulative returns are shown on y axis and prior and
subsequent trades relative to trade 0 are shown on x axis.
Figure 2.1 shows that there are large price movements prior to trade 0
for trades on SETS for both seller- and buyer-initiated trades, indicating
information leakage before trade 0. Conversely, price movements before
trades on the DM started immediately prior to trade 0. Prices after trade 0
stay high for later trades for SETS, but after dealer trades prices reverse.
We ﬁnd similar patterns for 30 trades and 10 trades. Following Booth et al.
(2002), we choose equilibrium price PB before trade t at t – 12 and equilibrium price after trade t at t  3 where PB is P12 and PA is P3.3 Price
movements in other trade value groups show similar patterns.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Table 2.1 shows that the average daily number of trades per stock is higher
on SETS than on the DM, but the size of each trade in terms of both number of shares and monetary value is higher on the DM. The size advantage

of the DM is evident even though these data exclude trades that are greater
than 8 NMS, which are mostly DM trades. Both quoted and effective
spreads are higher on SETS at the time orders are submitted to the DM
than at other times. The higher effective spread on SETS at the time when
orders are sent to the DM shows that many traders are actually timing their
trading venue and switching to the DM under particular conditions. We
view this as the purchase of (high-cost) liquidity when this liquidity is not
available on SETS.
For 2000, we present summary statistics for our sample of 149 ﬁrms.
The overall SETS and DM results are presented in columns 2 to 4. The

overall and for each size category. This is quite contrary to the notion that
theoretical models and empirical works suggest, that is, informed traders
prefer to trade in anonymous dealer systems where they do not have to disclose their trading interest ex-ante to the public. Barclay, Hendershott, and
McCormick (2003) report that there is a tendency for informed trades in
NASDAQ to migrate to anonymous electronic communication networks.
Our explanation for the lower permanent price impact lies in that the unique
features of the DM. The DM on the LSE does not permit open access.
Therefore, long-term relationships are essential and traders cannot afford to
conceal that a particular trade is informed.
For the 149 ﬁrms in our sample, we present the permanent, temporary,
and total price impact of trades on SETS and the DM both overall and by
relative trade size category. The permanent price impact of trade at time t is
computed as BS  ln (PA/PB)  100 where BS equals plus (minus) one for
buyer (seller) initiated trade and if a trade occurs at time t, designate the price
of that trade as PT, the price of the third subsequent trade as PA and the
price of the twelfth previous trade as PB. The temporary price impact of
trade at time t is computed as BS  ln (PT/PA)  100, and total price impact
of trade at time t is calculated as BS  ln (PT/PB)  100. The last column
presents the test of the mean difference between the SETS and DM.
Turning to temporary price impact, we ﬁnd that it is signiﬁcantly lower
on SETS than on the DM. In addition we ﬁnd that the temporary price
impact declines as order size increases. This is consistent with dealers offering signiﬁcant price improvement because of lack of intensive competition
for smaller trades. For large orders, dealers have the ability to extract additional information about the motivation behind the order ﬂow and beneﬁt
from such reputation effects, and signiﬁcant price improvements are often
achieved as a result. The smaller temporary price impact of large orders in
the DM is also consistent with the ﬁndings of Bernhardt et al. (2005) who
advance a price discount hypothesis.
Next, we investigate whether these differences in permanent and temporary price impacts across trading systems survive after controlling for ﬁrmspeciﬁc and trading characteristics. We control for the variables that are
known to affect transaction costs (Stoll, 2000) while estimating the following cross-sectional regression:
Y  b0  b1 SETS  b2 Cap  b3 Price  b4 Volatility
 b5 Freq  b6 Size  ε

(2.4)

33

34

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

where Y is the permanent price impact and temporary price impact, in turn,
SETS is an indicator dummy variable that is assigned a value 1 for SETS
and 0 for the DM, Cap is the natural log of the market capitalization (millions of GBP), Price is the natural log of the price, Volatility is the natural
log of the hourly return volatility (%) from the SETS or DM, Freq is the
natural log of the daily number of trade (000s) from the SETS or DM, and
Size is the natural log of share trade size from the SETS or DM.
Table 2.3 presents the regression results. Examining the regression with
the permanent price impact as the dependent variable, the adjusted R-square
exceeds 70 percent. The SETS dummy has a statistically signiﬁcant positive
coefﬁcient indicating that permanent price impact is greater for SETS
trades, whereas dealers are able to learn about the information contained in
an order and negotiate the trade price for supplying liquidity. Price, volatility, and trade size are signiﬁcantly positively related to the permanent price
impact and trading frequency is signiﬁcantly negatively related to permanent
price impact.
In Table 2.3 we present the results of cross-sectional regressions of the
price impact of trades for both the SETS and the DM. The sample comprises 298 observations (149 ﬁrms times 2 markets). The regression equations are: Y  b0  b1 SETS  b2 Cap  b3 Price  b4 Volatility  b5 Freq
 b6 Size  ε, where Y is permanent and temporary price impact, in turn.

(PA/PB)  100 where BS equals plus (minus) one for buyer (seller) initiated
trade and if a trade occurs at time t, designate the price of that trade as PT,
the price of the third subsequent trade as PA and the price of the twelfth
previous trade as PB. The temporary price impact of a trade at time t is
computed as BS  ln (PT/PA)  100. SETS is a dummy variable that
equals 1 if the observation is aggregated from the SETS market. Cap is the
natural log of the market capitalization (millions). Price is the natural log of
the price. Volatility is the natural log of the hourly return volatility (%)
from the SETS or DM. Freq is the natural log of the daily number of trade
(000s) from the SETS or DM. Size is the natural log of share trade size
from the SETS or DM.
Examining the regressions with the temporary price impact as the
dependent variable, the adjusted R-square is 78 percent. The SETS
dummy has a statistically signiﬁcant negative coefﬁcient indicating that the
liquidit y is cheaper on SETS and costly on the DM. However, not all
trades will automatically gravitate to SETS because total price impact is
lower on DM markets for larger trade sizes. Moreover, large trades may
simply be impossible to execute on SETS. Temporary price impact is lower
for ﬁrms with a higher price, more frequent trading, and larger-sized
trades. But higher volatility is associated with an increase in the temporary
price impact of trades.
Regression results in Table 2.3 are consistent with those presented in
Table 2.2 for SETS versus dealer comparisons as well as trade size comparisons. Coefﬁcients for the control variables are also consistent with previous
microstructure literature such as Stoll (2000).
Qualitatively similar results in terms of adjusted R-squares, and direction, magnitude, and statistical signiﬁcance of coefﬁcients are obtained
when we estimate Equation 2.4 separately for the SETS and DM and,
therefore, these results are not reported in tables for brevity.

CONCLUSION
We examine trading on the London Stock Exchange where the same stocks
are traded on a computer-based trading system called SETS and on a DM.
Dealers have no obligations to post quotes or to support the market in any
way. We ﬁnd that the SETS market has more trades overall, but the trades
are larger on the DM and the DM dominates very large sized trades.

35

36

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

We ﬁnd signiﬁcantly greater permanent price impact on SETS compared with the DM for both the overall sample and for each size category.
Consequently, we believe that the informed trades are routed to SETS
while the DM is able to effectively identify informed trades ex-ante. Such
identiﬁcation of trade motives enables dealers to either screen out the
informed trades, avoiding losses, or trade effectively with them. In the
process, dealers learn information useful for their own trading.
Further, we ﬁnd that the temporary price impact on the SETS market is
less than on the DM. However, we note that only small quantities are
traded on SETS so the temporary price impact could be large on SETS if
an order marched up the book. For larger trades, liquidity can be purchased
on the DM at a premium. Premiums paid to the dealers are justiﬁed if they
are less than the cost of marching up or down the order book to execute
large quantities. A multivariate investigation shows that our ﬁndings of
higher permanent and lower temporary price impacts on SETS hold after
we control for ﬁrm and trading characteristics.

Momentum Trading
for the Private
Investor
Alexander Molchanov and Philip A. Stork

ABSTRACT
This chapter explores the potential proﬁtability of a momentum strategy for
a private investor. Such a strategy is based on price continuation and requires
buying stocks that have performed well in the past while short selling underperforming stocks. In order to replicate a trading strategy readily attainable
by individual investors, we only select constituents of major worldwide
indexes. Consistent with prior work, we document strong momentum in
shares around the world. However, we also ﬁnd that when trading costs are
accounted for, momentum proﬁts disappear in some markets. Nevertheless,
in Australia and Canada, momentum proﬁts remain positive and signiﬁcant.

INTRODUCTION
Since the seminal paper by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), who analyze
returns to buying winners and selling losers, the so-called “momentum
effect” has been highlighted by both academics and practitioners alike.1 The
main presumption behind the momentum effect theory is that it is possible
to predict future price movements based on past price trends. More speciﬁcally, past winners keep outperforming past losers. The momentum effect is
of particular interest to researchers, as it is one of the best documented
challenges to the efﬁcient market hypothesis which, in its basic form, tells
39

40

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

us that price changes should be unpredictable. While several potential
explanations for the momentum effect have been proposed, a general consensus is yet to be reached.2
The apparent simplicity of a momentum strategy implementation makes
it an attractive choice for an individual investor. After all, one only needs to
rank stocks according to their past performance. This chapter analyzes the
proﬁtability of the momentum strategy for such an investor. The next question is which shares to select for inclusion in the momentum portfolio. We
select 220 of the world’s largest shares—constituents of well-known stock
indexes. We have two main reasons for making such a choice. First, these
shares are likely to have low transaction costs compared to other stocks.
Second, as Barber and Odean (2008) point out, individual investors, when
faced with a choice of thousands of stocks, tend to select those that catch
their attention. Index constituents are more likely to do that.
Consistent with prior studies, we document medium-term momentum in
all the markets we consider, including those of Western Europe, the United
States, Northern Europe, Australia, and Canada. Additionally, and to no
surprise, once trading costs have been accounted for then some of the profits disappear. However, momentum proﬁts in Australia and Canada remain
statistically and economically signiﬁcant, indicating that following a simple
momentum strategy could potentially generate abnormal returns, even for a
private investor.

DATA
We use only the largest shares that are traded in some of the most liquid
markets. For a private investor it is relatively easy to ﬁnd out which shares
make up any of the main share indexes available. In these largest shares, a
private investor will encounter very few, if any, problems when trading.
Going short will usually be possible at reasonable costs, as there is ample
supply. Moreover, the available price data will contain only a minimal
amount of the distortions that are often found in the share prices of smaller
stocks, including bid-ask bounces, unrepresentative prices due to infrequent
trading or other illiquidity related issues.
From Datastream, we download end-of-month return indexes and trading volumes of the constituent shares of ﬁve main equity indexes. The sample period runs from December 1991 to January 2008, comprising 193
observations in total. We have selected three indexes from Dow Jones &

c h a p t e r 3 M o m e n t u m T r a d i n g f o r t h e P r i vat e I n v e s t o r

Company, Inc. (Dow Jones) and two exchange-generated indexes. The ﬁrst
index is the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50, which consists of the 50 stocks
with the highest free-ﬂoat market capitalization of the 600 largest stocks
traded on the major exchanges of 18 European countries.3 Second, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average 30 Index represents large and well-known
U.S. companies. All industries are covered and the components are selected
at the discretion of The Wall Street Journal editors. Third, the Dow Jones
STOXX Nordic 30 provides a blue-chip representation of the super sector
leaders in the Nordic region, covering 30 stocks from Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. The S&P/ASX 50 index places an emphasis
on liquidity and comprises the 50 largest stocks by market capitalization in
Australia. Finally, the S&P/TSX 60 index is a list of the sixty largest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada as measured by market
capitalization. Together, these ﬁve indexes comprise 220 of the world’s
largest and most liquid stocks. This approach contrasts with other momentum studies which usually focus either on all shares listed on a national
exchange or on a sample of national indexes.
Prior to its announcement, an investor cannot know which shares will be
added or removed from the list of constituents. We have removed this
potential survivorship bias from our sample using proprietary data kindly
provided to us by Dow Jones. Stepwise, we assess per individual index
which shares are added and deleted monthly based on the information
retrieved from Dow Jones and the websites of the two exchanges. We manually adjust the lists of constituent shares accordingly. Each monthly list of
constituent shares that comprise the index thus reﬂects only the information available up until that date. This procedure ensures that the survivorship bias is removed from the data. Of the ﬁve indexes chosen, we were
unable to obtain all additions and deletions for only the S&P/ASX 50 and
the S&P/TSX 60 indexes. We are thus unable to adjust those two indexes
prior to January 2000 and therefore some survivorship bias may remain for
the period between 1992 and 1999. We have no reason to believe that this
has signiﬁcant affects on our results.

MOMENTUM TRADING RESULTS
We execute the following procedure to calculate momentum returns. The
ranking period is deﬁned as the period during which returns are calculated
in order to rank the shares according to their relative return levels. The

41

42

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

holding period is deﬁned as the period after the ranking period, during
which the returns from holding the shares are realized. Every month, for a
speciﬁc ranking period, the returns of all shares are calculated and ranked.
The top ﬁve winners are bought and the bottom ﬁve losers are sold short,
and we thus hold these 10 shares in position. We initially choose the minimum number of shares per long or short portfolio to equal ﬁve, as other
momentum trading studies also often use deciles. Furthermore, we below
analyze the effects of changing this number and show that a reduction
increases the momentum returns generated but at the same time lowers the
statistical reliability of the results.
We vary both the ranking and the holding period between 1 and 12
months. We utilize the investment rule that equally weighted momentum
strategies of varying vintages are simultaneously in effect at all times,
following Jegadeesh and Titman (1993, 2001) and Grifﬁn, Ji, and Martin
(2003). For comparison purposes, we apply the most commonly used
return calculation method. We acknowledge that the implicit monthly
rebalancing is potentially oversimplifying and may, in practice, increase
transaction costs, as pointed out by Liu and Strong (2008). Moreover, we
follow the common practice of skipping one month between ranking and
holding periods in order to minimize microstructure price distortions. As
a robustness test, we also calculated momentum returns without skipping
one month. The results obtained contain few surprises and are broadly in
line with, for example, the ﬁndings of Grifﬁn, Ji, and Martin (2003), and
are available from the authors upon request. For each of the ﬁve data samples, the annualized momentum returns are calculated. Table 3.1 reports
the returns for the highest versus lowest portfolio across several ranking
and holding period combinations. Corresponding t values are given in
parentheses.
Table 3.1 shows for all ﬁve geographical areas that positive momentum
returns are generated for the most commonly used ranking and holding
period combinations of 6, 9, and 12 months. Apparently, a sample size of
30 to 60 shares sufﬁces to convincingly demonstrate the pervasive presence of moment um effects. For three of the f ive samples (Europe,
Nordic, and the United States), the returns are statistically not signiﬁcant. For Australia and Canada, the returns are markedly higher and signiﬁcant, as conﬁrmed by the t statistics. For these samples, the annualized
returns range between 20 percent and 30 percent for various ranking and
holding periods.

A second observation is that the strength of the momentum effects
depends on the duration of the ranking and holding period. For the
shorter ranking periods of one and three months, the momentum returns
for several samples turn negative, although the amounts are statistically
insigniﬁcant. Our ﬁnding of lower momentum returns for the short-term
ranking periods is in line with prior empirical studies; see, for example,
Jegadeesh and Titman (2001).

ROBUSTNESS TESTS
In this section we conduct a number of robustness tests in order to analyze
in more detail the behavior of the momentum effect. We commence by
analyzing the behavior of the momentum returns over time. Could it be
that this is a disappearing phenomenon, or is it still present in the most
recent data? Figure 3.1 shows the average of all ﬁve areas’ cumulative
(12  6) momentum returns over the full duration of the sample.
The cumulative momentum returns in Figure 3.1 show a continuing
upward movement, albeit with several periods of severe volatility. In 2002,
for example, the returns strongly increased only to fall again in 2003. The
peak in cumulative returns of 2002 was not reached again until 2007.
Although the volatility of the returns is apparently quite high, the strong
positive trend nevertheless suggests that the momentum effect is still going
strong in recent years.
However, a further analysis, as seen below, indicates that the above conclusion is premature and that the true story is more nuanced. Instead of
averaging out the cumulative returns over the ﬁve samples, we now analyze
the results per individual sample. We split the period into two subperiods,
namely, 1992 to 1999 and 2000 to 2008. The respective average momentum returns are presented in Figure 3.2.

A surprising picture emerges from Figure 3.2. For the ﬁrst subperiod
1992 to 1999, four of the five samples generate average moment um
ret urns in excess of 10 percent. Only in the Nordic sample do the
momentum returns remain subdued at a meager 6.10 percent. However,
in the second subperiod 2000 to 2008, four of the ﬁve samples show
markedly lower momentum returns. For the Dow Jones Euro STOXX 50
and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 30 samples, the returns are less
than 2 percent and have thus almost totally disappeared. Only in the
Australian sample did the momentum returns increase during the second
subperiod.
Next, we analyze to what extent the results depend on the number of
shares being used in the trading strategy. In the above calculations we took
a position of ﬁve shares long and ﬁve shares short, thus a total of 10. We
now reduce the number of shares in the portfolios. It is of course easier
and cheaper to trade fewer shares, but if we do that we can expect more
erratic trading results due to less averaging out of the returns. To ensure

c h a p t e r 3 M o m e n t u m T r a d i n g f o r t h e P r i vat e I n v e s t o r

consistency, we continue to conduct the above-used (12  6) combination
of ranking and holding periods.4
For most samples, the most extreme losers and winners tend to show the
strongest momentum effects, which is in line with the results found in
Stork (2008). The cumulative momentum returns tend to reduce stepwise
from the first ranked shares to the fifth ranked shares. The average
momentum return is depicted in Figure 3.3. Although the details are not
discussed here, we ﬁnd a corresponding decrease in cumulative momentum
returns for most other holding and ranking periods. Our conclusion is that
the common practice used by momentum studies of dividing the shares
within the sample in deciles increases the statistical reliability yet, at the
same time, reduces the absolute size of the momentum effect. Raising the
number of shares in the momentum portfolio reduces both the expected
level and volatility of the returns. The investor who utilizes a momentum
investment strategy in the market faces this tradeoff.

TRADING WITH A VOLUME FILTER
In this section we present the results of applying a simple volume ﬁlter to
the positions. Several authors have already linked momentum and trading
volume. Conrad, Hameed, and Niden (1994) use weekly NASDAQ stock
prices between 1983 and 1990 and ﬁnd that for past losers, high trading
volumes predict high future returns. For winners, this relationship is less
evident. Momentum returns are higher if low volume losers are sold as
opposed to high volume losers.
The change in trading volume is calculated as the last month’s volume
divided by the average volume of the three preceding months. Lee and
Swaminathan (2000) show that most of the predictive power of trading volume is attributable to changes in the level of trading activity rather than
lagged volume. This result supports our choice of trading volume measurement. We have arbitrarily chosen a length of three months. However, we
ﬁnd that increasing the length to 6 or 12 months has only marginal impact
on our key ﬁndings.
We build on the Conrad, Hameed, and Niden (1994) study and ﬁlter
out those shares for which the trading volume changes more than a speciﬁed threshold. We set these ﬁlter-limits somewhat arbitrarily in order to
ensure that volume can neither have increased more than 10 percent nor

47

48

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

fallen more than 50 percent. Although we ﬁnd that the ﬁltered momentum returns do not depend strongly on the thresholds used in the volume ﬁlters, a more detailed sensitivity analysis falls outside the scope of
this chapter.
In some months, all winners or losers are f iltered out: for those
months, the strategy cannot be executed and no momentum return is
calculated. Table 3.2 shows the ﬁltered momentum trading returns, the
number of monthly returns, and the t statistics in parentheses for the
(12  6)-strategy.
Table 3.2 shows an interesting picture. In line with the results in Table 3.1,
we ﬁnd that for most samples the highest ﬁltered returns are generated when
using only a minimal number of shares. The returns are widely dispersed, ranging from a maximum of 64 percent to a minimum of 9 percent. Unsurprisingly, the volatility decreases when the portfolio size is augmented. Moreover,
use of the volume ﬁlter tends to cause the number of observations to decrease
and the returns to become more erratic. As a result, it is difﬁcult to draw any
consistent conclusions per individual sample. As a next step, we calculate average ﬁltered momentum returns for each portfolio size, which enables us to better compare the ﬁltered versus unﬁltered trading strategy results.

Figure 3.3 shows that for the smaller portfolios the average momentum
return increases after applying a volume ﬁlter. Even though marginal, the
difference for the (relatively) large sizes of four and ﬁve shares favors the
unﬁltered strategy. The highest average momentum returns are apparently
obtained by applying a volume ﬁlter on very small portfolios. These returns
ﬂuctuate wildly and are thus quite risky.

PRIVATE INVESTOR TRADING
Because of its simplicity, the momentum strategy with or without a ﬁlter
should in practice be tradable fairly easily and without too many costs. We
assume one-sided trading costs of 0.3 percent and a bid-offer spread of
0.3 percent as well. For consistency we continue to focus on the (12  6)strategy. For ease of exposition we ﬁrst focus on the smallest portfolios
which consist of one share long and one share short. We simultaneously buy
and sell these two shares and after six months conduct an offsetting trade.

49

50

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

We thus conduct four trades for each portfolio. Per portfolio, this means
that we pay four times the transaction costs of 0.3 percent and we lose two
times the bid-offer spread of 0.3 percent for a total of 1.8 percent. These
“costs” are incurred per portfolio that is held for six months, thus twice
per year, so that the overall trading costs equal 3.6 percent per year. On top
of these costs we must add the stock lending fee, usually expressed as a
percentage spread of, for example, 1 percent. Finally, we have to pay some
miscellaneous costs for events such as corporate actions, a ﬁxed-account fee
and a fee dependent on the number of shares registered with the broker. In
total, the miscellaneous fees should not exceed 0.4 percent. The total costs
amount to around 5 percent per year.
Our cost-estimates are fairly conservative and are likely to be lower in
practice for an experienced and savvy private investor. For example the bidoffer spread in blue chip shares usually is less than 0.3 percent. Moreover, if
somewhat larger amounts are traded, the trading costs will be lower as well.
Finally, we have assumed that each consecutive trading portfolio is different. In reality, however, shares stay in or out of market favor for prolonged
periods of time. In such scenarios the composition of the portfolio remains
unaltered and the number of trades comes out lower.
If total trading costs amount to around 5 percent, we conclude that for
the period since the year 2000 the unﬁltered momentum trading results
obtainable for the private investor were nil or even negative for the Euro,
Nordic, and U.S. areas. In Australia and Canada, however, a private investor
could have made signiﬁcant momentum proﬁts in excess of 10 percent per
annum even after deduction of all costs.

CONCLUSION
The momentum effect—past winners continuing to outperform past losers—has been one of the main challenges to the efﬁcient market hypothesis. Following a simple strategy of buying past winners and selling past
losers seems to generate signiﬁcantly positive abnormal returns in all the
markets we consider in this chapter. Our ﬁndings are robust to a number of
tests. We conﬁrm that momentum proﬁts do not disappear over time; they
are more pronounced for extreme winners and losers; and they are ampliﬁed with an application of a simple volume ﬁlter.
We are looking at the viability of the momentum strategy from the perspective of the private investor who is likely to encounter signiﬁcant trading

c h a p t e r 3 M o m e n t u m T r a d i n g f o r t h e P r i vat e I n v e s t o r

costs. Indeed, consistent with conventional wisdom and academic evidence,
once the trading costs are accounted for, some of the momentum proﬁts
disappear. Nevertheless, these proﬁts remain signiﬁcant in the Australian
and Canadian markets. However, one has to exercise caution in implementing such a strategy, as there is no guarantee these proﬁts will repeat themselves in the future.

Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subramanyam (1998) attribute momentum to
traders’ overconﬁdence; they ascribe the performance of ex-post winners to superior stock selection, while ex-post losers are explained by
bad luck. Therefore, delayed overreaction will drive the momentum
proﬁts. Hong and Stein (1999) assume that investors use only partial
information to update their expectations. This will cause short-run
underreactions and long-run overreactions, resulting in momentum
proﬁts.

Trading in
Turbulent Markets
Does Momentum Work?
Tim A. Herberger and Daniel M. Kohlert

ABSTRACT
Identifying ways to successfully predict security returns based on past
returns is a major objective of investment research. One of the most important strategies, that of momentum (Lev y, 1967; Jegadeesh and Titman,
1993; Oehler et al., 2003), is employed in this chapter. Using NYSE data
from December 1994 to May 2009, we analyze whether buying stocks that
have performed well in the past and selling stocks that have performed
poorly in the past can generate signiﬁcant positive returns, even in a turbulent market phase. Our ﬁndings suggest that investors using momentum
strategies could have indeed generated superior returns during that time
period.

INTRODUCTION
Since it was ﬁrst reported by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), the momentum
phenomenon has been extensively discussed in the literature. Based on the
concept of “Relative Strength” by Levy (1967), the authors argue that contrary to the neoclassic efﬁcient market hypothesis, stock prices are autocorrelated. For the U.S. stock market they ﬁnd that trading strategies that
buy stocks which have performed well in the past and sell stocks that have
performed poorly in the past can achieve abnormal market-adjusted returns
that could not exist if the market was efﬁcient. After Jegadeesh and Titman
(1993), many studies tried to reproduce their results by testing momentum
investment strategies in other stock markets: For example, Rouwenhorst

53

54

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

(1998) shows that momentum can be found in a sample of 12 European
stock markets. Chui, Titman, and Wei (2000) conﬁrm momentum for eight
Asian stock markets (without Japan), and Glaser and Weber (2003) show
that investment strategies based on momentum can be proﬁtable in the
German stock market. In an experimental study, Oehler et al. (2003) identify momentum traders and disposition investors.
This chapter uses NYSE data from December 1994 to May 2009 to
examine whether momentum can still be found on the U.S. stock market.
This is particularly interesting as the sample period covers extreme market
moves resulting from the rise and fall of dot-com stocks at the beginning of
this century and from the current ﬁnancial crisis. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant positive abnormal returns on a market-adjusted basis for a short-term strategy
with equally long ranking and holding periods of 3 months as well as for a
medium-term strategy based on 6-month-long ranking and holding periods.
This holds true even after transaction costs are considered. A long-term
strategy based on 12-month-long ranking and holding periods, however,
does not produce signiﬁcant abnormal returns.
The chapter is organized as follows. The second section of this chapter
provides a literat ure review, and in the third section we explain the
dataset and introduce the methodology adopted. The presentation of the
empirical results follows in this chapter’s fourth section, and the ﬁfth section concludes.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Although the proﬁtability of momentum strategies is rarely disputed, there
is still a great deal of controversy over the reasons for such abnormal
ret urns. Neoclassical economists attempt to explain moment um as a
rational compensation for risk, a liquidit y premium and /or an illusion
induced by market frictions (Fuertes, Miffre, and Tan, 2009). Lesmond,
Schill, and Zhou (2004), for instance, argue that moment um cannot
be proﬁtably exploited when transaction costs are considered. Korajczyk
and Sadka (2004), however, ﬁnd that transaction costs can only partially
explain the profits of momentum strategies. Conrad and Kaul (1998)
argued that cross-sectional variation can potentially explain the proﬁtability
of momentum strategies, and Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) ﬁnd that it is
for the most part attributable to momentum in different industries. After
controlling for momentum across industries, the authors hardly ﬁnd a proﬁt

chapter 4 Trading in Turbulent Markets

in individual stock returns. Another explanation is offered by Wu (2002)
and Wang (2003) who assume that the proﬁtability of momentum trading is
a result of time-variation in expected returns. Grundy and Martin (2001)
and Karolyi and Kho (2004) show, however, that neither industry effects,
time-variation in expected returns, nor cross-sectional disparities are the
main reasons for the momentum effect and that these factors can explain it
only partially. Also, while Chordia and Shivakumar (2002) indicate that
some macroeconomic variables (e.g., the yield on a three-month T-bill)
predict the momentum phenomenon and the associated payoffs, Grifﬁn, Ji,
and Martin (2003) show that this approach also offers an only incomplete
explanation.
Behavioral economists follow another approach. They arg ue that
momentum is a consequence of cognitive biases and/or limits to arbitrage.
In the model of Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), momentum results
from conservatism while representativeness leads to overvaluation and consequently to price correction. Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam
(1998) argue that biased self-attribution and overconﬁdence are the reasons
for the predictability of equity returns. Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok
(1996) as well as Hong and Stein (1999) attributed momentum to an only
gradual distribution of new information on the market.1 Chui, Titman, and
Wei (2009) ﬁnd indications in their analysis of 55 countries that cultural
differences affect stock return patterns and the extent of the success of
momentum trading. They argue that individuals from different countries
respond differently to risk. Hwang and Rubesam (2008), however, note that
at least for the U.S. stock market momentum proﬁts have slowly eroded
since the early 1990s.

DATA AND METHODOLOGY
Monthly stock prices over the period December 31, 1994 to May 31, 2009
are obtained from Datastream for all common stocks listed on the NYSE,
excluding American depository receipts (ADRs), real estate investment trusts
(REITs), closed-end funds, and companies which were delisted during the
evaluation period. For our analysis we use returns adjusted for capital gains
and dividends. An equally weighted NYSE Index that consists of all shares of
the dataset is used as a market proxy. The momentum strategy is intended as
a zero-cost portfolio strategy that buys stocks that have performed well in the
past and sells stocks that have performed poorly in the past.

We basically follow the methodology of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993). We
couch everything in terms of raw returns, and we equally weight these returns.
However, in contrast to Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), we do not analyze 16 but
three trading strategies: we use a short-term strategy with a ranking period J of
3 months and an equal holding period K ( J  3/K  3), a medium-term strategy consisting of a 6-month ranking period as well as a 6-month holding
period ( J  6 /K  6), and a long-term strategy with a ranking period of
12 months and a holding period of 12 months ( J  12/K  12). To increase
the power of our tests, we construct overlapping test runs like Moskowitz and
Grinblatt (1999), Jegadeesh and Titman (2001), and Fuertes, Miffre, and Tan
(2009). This results in 167 test runs for the 3/3 trading strategy, 161 test runs
for the 6/6 strategy, and 149 test runs for the 12/12 strategy. While Jagadeesh
and Titman (1993) sort stocks into 10 deciles according to past performance,
and then measure the return differential of the most extreme deciles which
they denote by P10 – P1, we place even more emphasis on the tails of the performance distribution.
One month after the ranking takes place, we sort our sample into only
two parts based on past performance: P1, which includes the worst-performing 1 percent, and P2, which includes the best-performing 1 percent of
NYSE stocks in the ranking period. Our basic measure of momentum is
then P2 – P1. The top 1 percent portfolio is the winners’ portfolio and the
bottom 1 percent portfolio is the losers’ portfolio. The stocks in the individual portfolios are equally weighted. Contrast to Jegadeesh and Titman
(1993), Jegadeesh and Titman (2001), and most former studies, the two
extreme portfolios are formed in order to maximize performance and to
minimize transaction costs. This, however, implies fewer diversiﬁcation
beneﬁts in the portfolios. In order to avoid biases because of low-priced
stocks, which are documented for example in Conrad and Kaul (1993), particularly for January, we follow the method of Jegadeesh and Titman (2001)
and Fuertes, Miffre, and Tan (2009) by (temporarily) excluding stocks
which are priced below $5 at the end of the ranking period.
By skipping a month between the end of the ranking period and the
beginning of the holding period like Rouwenhorst (1998), we avoid some
of the bid-ask spread, price pressure, and lagged effects, which could skew
our results. These effects are documented for example in Jegadeesh
(1990) and Lehmann (1990). The gross return of a test run (cumulative
return of a holding period of T months in test run i, CRi,T) is deﬁned as
follows:

chapter 4 Trading in Turbulent Markets

T

CRi ,T = ∑⎡⎣RW,t − RL,t ⎤⎦

(4.1)

t =0

where RW,t is the monthly return of the winners’ portfolio and RL,t represents
the monthly return of the losers’ portfolio.
The market-adjusted return of a test run (cumulative abnormal return of
a holding period of T months in test run i, CARi,T) is deﬁned as follows:
T

CARi ,T = ∑⎡⎣( RW,t − RL,t ) − R M,t ⎤⎦

(4.2)

t =0

where R W,t is the monthly return of the winners’ portfolio and RL,t represents the monthly return of the losers’ portfolio. RM,t is the monthly return
of the equally weighted NYSE Index.
For evaluating the success of a trading strategy it is essential to consider
transaction costs, which are incurred when the portfolios are assembled and
when the strategy closes out the positions at the end of a test run.2 In our
study we consider three different rates of transaction costs that depend on
the type of investor employing the momentum strategy. Following Bromann, Schiereck, and Weber (1997), we assume that institutional investors
face transaction cost of 0.2 percent for every purchase or sale (4x), wealthy
private clients 0.5 percent (4x), and private clients 1.0 percent (4x).3 The
market-adjusted return after transaction cost of a test run (cumulative
abnormal return after transaction costs with a holding period of T months
in test run i, CARTi,t) is deﬁned as follows:
T

(

)

CARTi ,T = ∑⎡⎣ RWt, − RL,t − TC,t − R M ,t ⎤⎦
t =0

(4.3)

where RW, t is the monthly return of the winners’ portfolio and RL,t represents the monthly return of the losers’ portfolio. Rm,t is the monthly return
of the equally weighted NYSE Index and TC, t is the rate of transaction costs
per month.

Table 4.1 Average Monthly Returns of Momentum Portfolios in the Period
from 1994 to 2009
Table 4.1 presents average equally weighted monthly returns in percentages for price
momentum portfolio strategies involving NYSE stocks from December 1994 to May 2009. At
the end of each month, all stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the actual t and the
past J  1 months’ cumulative returns. One month after the ranking takes place, two equally
weighted, monthly rebalanced, extreme portfolios are constructed that consist of the 1 percent
of NYSE stocks with the highest returns and the 1 percent with the lowest returns in the
ranking period. P1 represents the low-return loser portfolio, and P2 represents the high-return
winner portfolio. Overlapping portfolios are constructed to increase the power of the tests.
K represents holding periods where K  3, 6, or 12 months. Returns of the winner and loser
portfolios in t are simply the average of J portfolio returns. The momentum portfolio (P2 – P1)
is the zero-cost, winner minus loser portfolio. For monthly returns, t statistics are shown in
parentheses.

The table shows that for the strateg y with a 3-month ranking and a
3-month holding period ( J  3 /K  3), an equally weighted portfolio
formed from the stocks in the bottom percentile of previous 3-month
performance returns –1.67 percent per month, 2.05 percent less than the
top percentile portfolio which returns 0.38 percent. In the case of the
second strategy with a ranking period of 6 months and a holding period of
6 months ( J  6 /K  6), an equally weighted loser portfolio returns –1.87
percent per month, 2.19 percent less than the winner portfolio which
returns 0.32 percent. Finally, a ranking period of 12 months and a holding
period of 12 months ( J  12 /K  12) leads to a return of 0.27 percent.

chapter 4 Trading in Turbulent Markets

In this case, an equally weighted portfolio formed from the stocks in the
bottom percent of previous three-month performance returns –0.91 percent
per month, while the top percent portfolio returns –0.61 percent. Average
overall returns are highest for the medium-term strategy. This supports the
approach in the literature to mainly focus on this strategy based on 6-month
ranking and holding periods (e.g., Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993; Rouwenhorst,
1998; Hong, Lim, and Stein, 2000). The winners of the short-term strategy
have much higher returns than the losers. For both the short-term and the
medium-term strategy, returns are signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level. For the
long-term strategy, both winner and loser returns are negative, very close to
each other, and not signiﬁcant.
Compared with previous ﬁndings in the literature, the negative returns
of the loser portfolios are relatively high. Jegadeesh and Titman (1993),
Jegadeesh and Titman (2001), Rouwenhorst (1998), and Hong, Lim, and
Stein (2000), for example, do not ﬁnd negative returns for their loser portfolios at all. However, these authors report considerably higher average
returns of their winners’ portfolios. As for our data the difference between
winner and loser portfolios is still greater, we ﬁnd a higher overall performance of our momentum portfolios. Besides the effect of a potential survivorship bias due to the omission of delisted stocks, a reason for the
higher returns we ﬁnd is likely to be that we chose smaller and more
extreme portfolios and through this exchanged higher returns for higher
risk by foregoing diversiﬁcation beneﬁts. As Rouwenhorst (1998) aptly
states, stocks with higher standard deviations, all else equal, are more likely
to show unusual performance.
Looking at the risk of the three momentum portfolios, we ﬁnd that the
standard deviations decrease with the time horizon of the strategies. While
the short-term portfolio has a monthly standard deviation of 6.06 percent,
the medium-term portfolio’s standard deviation is 4.33 percent, and the
long-term portfolio’s standard deviation is 3.02 percent. Interestingly, the
medium-term strategy has a higher return and simultaneously a lower standard deviation than the short-term strategy. Although the lower standard
deviation of the long-term strategy comes along with a lower return, as
expected, the relationship between risk and return is worst in this case.
Compared with Rouwenhorst (1998) who reports monthly standard deviations of 5.62 percent for his loser (decile) portfolio, and of 5.27 percent for
his winner (decile) portfolio for the momentum strategy based on 6-month

59

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

ranking and holding periods, our standard deviations, which result from
portfolios that contain only the top and bottom 1 percent of available
stocks, do not seem overly high. A further reason for the high returns of
the strategy may be the particular characteristics of the time period from
1994 to 2009 that we are looking at. With the dot-com bubble at the beginning of the twentieth century as well as with the ﬁnancial crisis the market
faced two strong as well as prolonged declines which should at least partly
be responsible for the highly negative returns of the loser portfolios and the
only slightly positive returns of the winner portfolios.
Table 4.2 presents the average monthly abnormal returns of the momentum portfolios using the average monthly NYSE return as the market
proxy. The returns have been obtained based on the methodology discussed
in section two. Panel A shows the returns of the market proxy as adjusted
to the respective strategy, the raw return of the momentum portfolios, and
the abnormal returns resulting from subtracting market from momentum
returns. As expected based on the results of Table 4.1, the average monthly
abnormal return is highest for the medium-term strategy with 2.08 percent.
The abnormal return of the short-term strategy is also considerably high
with 1.83 percent. Both returns are signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level. The
long-term strategy produces the lowest and nonsigniﬁcant abnormal return
of 0.01 percent.
Assessing the proﬁtability of momentum trading strategies requires an
assessment of the trading costs. Panel B therefore shows average monthly
returns that have been adjusted for a 0.2 percent transaction costs rate.
While the short-term strateg y’s average monthly abnormal ret urn is
1.56 percent, the medium-term strategy returns 1.95 percent, and the
long-term strategy 0.03 percent. Again, both returns of the short-term as
well as the medium-term strategies are signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level.
Panel C shows average monthly abnormal returns that have been adjusted
for a 0.5 percent transaction costs rate. In this case, the short-term strategy’s average monthly abnormal return is 1.40 percent and it is signiﬁcant
at the 1 percent level. The medium-term strategy returns 2.10 percent in
excess of the market. The return is signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level. The
long-term strategy is characterized by an insigniﬁcant abnormal return of
0.02 percent.
In Panel D, transaction costs are increased to 1 percent. Although the
short-term strategy still returns 0.45 percent in excess of the market, this
return is no longer signiﬁcant. The long-term strategy now underperforms

Table 4.2 Abnormal Montly Returns of Momentum Portfolios Using the Average NYSE Return as the Market Proxy over
the Time Period from 1994 until 2009
This table presents average monthly abnormal returns in percentages for price momentum portfolio strategies involving NYSE stocks from December 1994
to May 2009. P represents the return of the momentum portfolio, i.e., the zero-cost, winner minus loser portfolio, for a given J/K-strategy. J represents
ranking periods, where J  3, 6, or 12 months, and K represents holding periods where K  3, 6, or 12 months. M represents the average NYSE return
which is used as the market proxy. The abnormal return of the momentum portfolios using the average NYSE return as the market proxy (P – M) is
calculated by subtracting market return from momentum return. In Panel A, raw returns are presented without considering transaction costs. In Panel B,
transaction costs of 0.2 percent are considered in calculating the return of the momentum portfolio. In Panel C, transaction costs of 0.5 percent are
considered in calculating the return of the momentum portfolio. In Panel D, transaction costs of 1 percent are considered in calculating the return of the
momentum portfolio. For monthly return differences, t statistics are shown in parentheses.

the market by 0.25 percent. Only the medium-term strategy signiﬁcantly
outperforms the market at the 1 percent level with an abnormal return of
1.39 percent. In general, these returns show that the momentum effect not
only existed in the period we observed, but also that it could have been
proﬁtably exploited even after considering transaction costs. This at least
applies to the investor who is willing to bear the considerable risk of using
this strategy based on the very extremes of the considered stocks’ return
distribution.
This table presents average monthly abnormal returns in percentages
for price momentum portfolio strategies involving NYSE stocks from
December 1994 to May 2009. P represents the return of the momentum
portfolio, i.e., the zero-cost, winner minus loser portfolio, for a given J/Kstrategy. J represents ranking periods, where J  3, 6, or 12 months, and K
represents holding periods where K  3, 6, or 12 months. M represents the
average NYSE return which is used as the market proxy. The abnormal
return of the momentum portfolios using the average NYSE return as the
market proxy (P – M) is calculated by subtracting market return from
momentum return. In Panel A, raw returns are presented without considering transaction costs. In Panel B, transaction costs of 0.2 percent are considered in calculating the return of the momentum portfolio. In Panel C,
transaction costs of 0.5 percent are considered in calculating the return of
the momentum portfolio. In Panel D, transaction costs of 1 percent are considered in calculating the return of the momentum portfolio. For monthly
return differences, t statistics are shown in parentheses.

CONCLUSION
Using NYSE data from December 1994 to May 2009, we analyze whether
momentum trading strategies can generate signiﬁcant positive returns even
in a turbulent market phase. Our ﬁndings suggest that even after years of
academic analysis and considerable awareness of momentum effects investors
can still generate superior returns using momentum portfolio strategies. We
ﬁnd signiﬁcant positive abnormal market-adjusted returns for short- and
medium-term momentum strategies based on equally long ranking and formation periods of 3 and 6 months, respectively. A long-term strategy based
on equally long ranking and formation periods of 12 months, however, cannot signiﬁcantly outperform the market. Even after considering transaction

chapter 4 Trading in Turbulent Markets

costs of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 percent, respectively, there are signiﬁcant results.
Only the medium-term strategy based on 6-month ranking and holding
periods, however, signiﬁcantly outperforms the market if transaction costs
are set to 1 percent. Interestingly, the strategy based on 6-month ranking
and holding periods offers the highest return while simultaneously having
the lowest risk in terms of standard deviation.

The Financial
Futures Momentum
Juan Ayora and Hipòlit Torró

ABSTRACT
The momentum strategy is the most famous anomaly arguing against the
hypothesis of ﬁnancial market efﬁciency. In this chapter, the momentum
strategy produces a signiﬁcant abnormal return for holding periods of six
months and one year using ﬁnancial futures (stock indexes, currencies, and
ﬁxed income). Furthermore, this study characterizes those futures contracts that contribute to the momentum strategy return. When the sample
is split in two groups, depending on the level of volatility, a signiﬁcantly
higher return is obtained in the high volatility group. Moreover, when the
sample of futures is split in four groups, depending on the trading volume
and open interest levels, those contracts with high trading volume and low
open interest report the best momentum performance.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years a large number of studies have analyzed several investing
strategies that produce abnormal returns in ﬁnancial markets. As a result,
the efﬁciency of these markets has been again questioned, especially after
many hedge funds put these strategies into practice. The momentum effect
is one of the most important phenomena studied in the literature. This
effect is based on the hypothesis that those assets with the best (worst)
return performance in the past will continue to perform similarly (best or
worst) in the future. The trading rule to exploit this return pattern is very

67

68

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

simple: take long positions in those assets with the best performance in the
past and short positions in those assets with the worst past performances.
The momentum effect has been found to be signiﬁcant for investment horizons of between nine months and a year. There is no agreement about an
explanation for the momentum effect. The most important line of work
tries to relate the momentum effect strategy return with macroeconomic
variables. This line of work produces quite successful results, and some
authors assert that this phenomenon is compatible with the efﬁciency
hypothesis—when returns are properly adjusted by risk.
In this chapter, we will study the momentum effect on ﬁnancial futures
markets. This work will contribute to the literature by relating the momentum strategy return with liquidity linked variables (trading volume and
open interest) and volatility.

LITERATURE REVIEW
The most important studies covering the momentum effect in stock markets are those of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993, 2001). These authors ﬁnd
signiﬁcant abnormal returns for intermediate investment horizons of up to
one year. Recently, Shen, Szakmary, and Sharma (2007), Miffre and Rallis
(2007), and Pirrong (2005) found abnormal returns in futures markets for
the momentum strategy. Shen et al. (2007) and Miffre and Rallis (2007)
studied the momentum effect in commodity futures markets. Miffre and
Rallis (2007) concluded that momentum strategies buy backwardated contracts and sell contangoed contracts.
The momentum effect survives as the most famous anomaly that argues
against the hypothesis of ﬁnancial market efﬁciency. There is consensus in
the literature that the proﬁtability of momentum-based trading strategies
cannot be fully accounted for in the context of market factor models1. An
outstanding contribution in this ﬁeld is made by Karolyi and Kho (2004).
These authors propose a very complete bootstrap procedure to test the
return abnormality in momentum-based strategies. Speciﬁcally, they compute time-varying expected returns with market-wide and macroeconomic
instrumental variables—and they are able to explain almost 80 percent of
the proﬁts.
There are few studies relating the momentum effect in futures markets
with open interest, traded volume, and volatility. Bessembinder and Seguin

chapter 5 The Financial Futures Momentum

(1993) make an important contribution in this ﬁeld. They ﬁnd a positive
relationship between volatility and traded volume and a negative relationship between volatility and open interest. Lee and Swaminathan (2000) use
past traded volume to predict the persistence of the momentum effect in
stock markets.

DATA
The database used is extracted from a CD published by the Commodity
Research Bureau (CRB). Speciﬁcally, we have collected closing prices, traded
volumes, and open interest. Futures return time-series have been computed
while carefully avoiding mixing futures contracts with differing maturities.
The contracts are rolled over two weeks before the futures maturity.
The sample includes a set of 18 contracts representing the most important markets in the world. 2 The list includes seven currency f ut ures
(Euro/USD, Yen/USD, Canadian dollar/USD, British pound/USD,
Australian dollar/USD, Swiss franc/USD, and U.S. dollar index); six stock
index futures (CAC 40, FTSE 100, Nikkei 225, S&P 500, Swiss market
index, Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50); and ﬁve ﬁxed income futures (Euro
bund 10-Y, Canadian government bond 10-Y, U.S. Treasury note 2-Y, U.S.
Treasury note 5-Y, and U.S. Treasury note 10-Y). We have excluded commodity futures contracts because commodity price time-series have speciﬁc
special features and have been already studied in Shen et al. (2007) and
Mifre and Rallis (2007). The period for the returns time-series runs from
May 1991 to December 2007. The time-series of volume and open interest
covers the period January 2001 to December 2007. On average, the transaction costs of the 18 contracts have been estimated at 0.096 percent over
the average nominal contract values for the studied period. This cost
includes the bid-ask spread, and an estimation of the intermediation commission for opening and closing futures positions.

METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS
Following the methodology in previous studies such as Shen et al. (2007)
and Jegadeesh and Titman (1993, 2001), we have tested the existence of the
momentum effect in a sample of futures contracts. We have constructed
basic momentum tests as follows. Firstly, we deﬁne ﬁve formation periods

69

70

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

(F) and ﬁve holding periods (H). We have chosen the following period
lengths for F and H: 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The reported tables will
display results only for F  H, the remaining combinations of F and H
periods are omitted to save space. Based on each futures return in the F
period, we then group the periods into one of three portfolios (P1, P2, and
P3), where P1 contains the six futures with highest past returns (winners);
and P3 contains the six futures with lowest past returns (losers). The
remaining six futures are included in the P2 portfolio. We then compute
portfolio returns for each holding period. Finally, the momentum portfolio
return is calculated: P1 – P3. That is, the momentum portfolio contains
long positions in the past winning contracts and short positions in the past
losing contracts.
A momentum effect will exist if the average return of this portfolio is
positive and signiﬁcantly different from zero. To test the signiﬁcance of
momentum proﬁts in each portfolio, we use t statistics that are asymptotically distributed such as N(0,1) under the null hypothesis that the true
proﬁts are zero. Because we generally use overlapping data, we have corrected our standard errors for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation using
the Newey and West adjustment.

Momentum Strategy Proﬁts
Table 5.1 presents the results for the whole sample and F  E periods. All
the returns are annualized to facilitate comparison. Two market indicators
are reported in each row to complete the analysis. The ﬁrst indicator,
termed reference, is an equally weighted portfolio with a long position
in each of the 18 contracts in the sample. The second indicator is the
S&P 500 index. Results in Table 5.1 show that all the momentum strategies
obtain positive returns: but only for the 6- and 12-month periods are the
mean returns signiﬁcantly different to zero at the 5 percent of signiﬁcance
level.3 Furthermore, the mean return of momentum strategies for 6 and 12
months is more than 500 basic points higher than the reference portfolio
and the S&P 500 annual returns. These results are similar to Jagadeesh and
Titman (1993 and 2001) for 6- and 12-month periods. Nevertheless, we
found no overreactation evidence in the way De Bondt and Thaler (1985,
1987) and Conrad and Kaul (1998) found for the 24-month period in the
U.S. stock markets.

This table provides annualized means of holding period (H) returns for various portfolios. The P1, P2, and P3
columns contain the portfolio returns for the winning, intermediate, and losing contracts for each formation
period (F ). Below the means are t statistics and based on Newey and West standard errors. The reference
column reports the annualized average return of an equally weighted portfolio composed of long positions in
the 18 futures contracts. In the last column, the annualized average return of the S&P 500 is provided as a
benchmark.

Momentum and Volatility
Pirrong (2005) suggests that differences in volatility across futures can
mask the momentum effect because highly volatile contracts will be winners or losers more frequently than less volatile contracts. Nevertheless,
his analysis shows that the momentum effect persists after futures returns
are standardized by their own volatility. We will study this point further.
We have split the 18 contracts in two groups of nine contracts, according
to their daily volatility during the sample period. Table 5.2 reports the
results for the nine most volatile (Panel A), and the nine least volatile
(Panel B) contracts. Most volatile contracts show positive returns higher
than the corresponding returns appearing in Table 5.1. On the contrary,
less volatile contracts show returns signiﬁcantly below the corresponding
returns appearing in Table 5.1. The only momentum strategy in Table 5.2
with an average return signiﬁcantly different to zero at the 5 percent signiﬁcance level is the six-month momentum strategy in Panel A; and it is
signiﬁcantly higher than the corresponding return in Table 5.1 using the
z test (z  3.365).4 Therefore, we can conclude that the momentum effect
is more persistent in highly volatile futures contract portfolios.

Momentum, Trading Volume and Open Interest
Using a similar approach to Wan and Yu (2004), we analyzed the inﬂuence
of traded volume on momentum strategy returns. The trading volumes and
open interest used are not speciﬁc to the nearest contract, as this information is not reported on the CRB CD. Rather, these ﬁgures are in terms of
the notional dollar value of contracts for all maturity months, deﬁned as the
total number of contracts traded multiplied by the nearby futures price—
multiplied by the contract multiplier. For those futures whose prices are
not in dollars, the corresponding exchange rate is used. To measure the
traded volume inﬂuence on momentum strategies we follow a two-step procedure. First, in each formation period, we divide the 18 contracts in two
groups, depending on the relative increases in traded volume with regard to
the previous formation period. In a second stage, we build the P1, P2, and
P3 portfolios within each group in the usual way; and then calculate the
momentum strategy return.
Panel A and Panel B in Table 5.3 provide momentum strategy returns
for those futures with high and low relative increases in traded volume,
respectively. Results in Panel A and Panel B show that the only signiﬁcant
average momentum strategy return corresponds to 12 months, with average return of 11.642 percent and 15.284 percent and Newey and West t

statistics of 2.925 and 11.727, respectively. Furthermore, the 12-month,
low-volume, momentum average return is signiﬁcantly higher than the
12-month, high-volume return using the z test (z  5.63). Therefore, we
can deduce that the momentum effect is more persistent in futures portfolios with low relative increases in traded volume. Lee and Swaminathan
(2000) found that momentum is stronger among high-volume stocks.
This result seems contrary to our results in futures markets; nevertheless,
all futures contracts included in the sample can be considered as liquid
assets and, in addition, the liquidity measures used in both studies are not
comparable.
Another important variable in futures market microstructure analysis
is open interest. In Bessembinder and Seguin (1993), open interest is

73

74

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

taken as a measure of market depth. Therefore, the inﬂuence of trading
activit y in momentum strategies will be more complete if we analyze
their sensitivity to different levels of open interest. To measure the inﬂuence of open interest on momentum strategies we follow a similar procedure to that used above for traded volume. First, for each formation
period, we divide the 18 contracts in two groups, depending on their relative increase in open interest with regard to the previous formation
period. In a second stage, we build the P1, P2, and P3 portfolios within
each g roup in the usual way and calculate the moment um strateg y
return. Panel A and Panel B in Table 5.4 provide momentum strategy
returns for those futures with high and low relative increases in open
interest, respectively.
Results in Table 5.4 show that the only signiﬁcant average momentum
strategy return corresponds to the 12-month period in Panel A, with an
average return of 11.02 percent and a Newey and West t statistic of 2.91.
Furthermore, the 6- and 12-month momentum returns in Panel A are signiﬁcantly above the corresponding returns in Panel B. Therefore, we can
deduce that the momentum effect is more persistent in futures portfolios
with high relative increases in open interest.
From the previous analysis of the inf luence of trading activit y on
momentum strategy returns an investor would choose those contracts with
low relative increases in traded volume and high relative increases in open

interest. However, an investor might be unable to apply both criteria
simultaneously. On this point, we need to study how both activity measures interact in order to obtain feasible trading rules. In a similar way to
the above cases, we have followed a three-step procedure. First, for each
formation period we divide all the sample contracts into two groups,
depending on the relative increases in traded volume. In each of these two
groups we then divide the contracts in two more subgroups, according to
the relative increase in open interest. In a third stage, we build the P1, P2,

Panels A, B, C, and D report momentum strategy returns in four groups after dividing all the sample
contracts in two groups, depending on their relative increases in traded volume. The contracts in both of
these groups are then divided into two subgroups, depending on the relative increases in open interest. See
notes at the foot of Table 5.1 for more comments.

momentums are for 6 and 12 months in Panel C with average returns of
10.017 percent and 8.254 percent; and Newey and West t statistics of 3.805
and 2.298, respectively. Therefore, when we let open interest and traded
volume interact, we can see that the momentum effect is more persistent in
futures portfolios with high relative increases in traded volume and low relative increases in open interest.
This conclusion agrees with Bessembinder and Seguin (1993) in relation
to volatility, trading volume, and open interest. Bessembinder and Seguin
(1993) found that unexpected volume shocks have an asymmetric effect on
volatility: the impact of high unexpected volume shocks on volatility being
larger than the impact of negative shocks. Nevertheless, an unexpected level
of open interest mitigates the volume effect on volatilit y because it is
inversely related. We have found a similar result for the momentum strategy. Momentum strategies are more persistent for highly volatile futures,
high relative increases in trading volume, and low relative increases in open
interest (see Tables 5.2 and 5.5). This is a sensible result as it would be
expected that high return investment strategies are associated with high
volatility; and this is consistent with the efﬁciency hypothesis. Furthermore,
futures contracts with high trading volumes and low open interest are
probably f ut ures with a higher speculative component (see Wan and
Yu, 2004).

Efﬁciency Tests and Risk Evaluation
One important point in an analysis of momentum strategies is to test if
returns are abnormally high. That is, if the strategy returns reﬂect only a
reward for risk. Following Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), we ﬁrst computed
risk-adjusted returns using the CAPM and the Fama and French (1993)
three-factor model (not reported because of space restrictions). Both
tests showed that risk-adjusted momentum returns were positive, but
smaller, and signiﬁcantly different to zero for 6 and 12 month periods at
the 5 percent and 10 percent signiﬁcance level, respectively. Therefore, the
traditional tests can only partially explain momentum strategy returns
(about 50 percent).
Following Shen et al. (2007), we also analyzed the distributional properties of momentum returns. The test proposed by Shen et al. (2007) is based
on a control strategy. In this control strategy, for each month, futures are

chapter 5 The Financial Futures Momentum

randomly assigned to the P1, P2, and P3 portfolios in the formation period,
and the P1 – P3 return is computed for each holding period. This procedure continues until the sample period is complete and this enables us to
obtain a return average similar to the momentum strategy. This simulation
is repeated 1,000 times for each pair of F/H periods in order to obtain the
control strategy distribution.
It can be seen in Table 5.6 that when comparing momentum returns in
Panel A against control strategy distribution in Panel B, that the momentum return means for 6- and 12-month periods remain extremely high.
The average momentum returns for these periods are 6.488 percent and
7.847 percent, respectively. These average returns are above the 99.5 percentile of the empirical distribution of the 1,000 simulated control strategies (4.584 percent and 5.005 percent, respectively). Therefore, it seems
that taking long positions in past winners and short positions in past losers
offers extremely high returns. However, are these returns abnormally
high? To answer this question we compute the Sharpe ratio for each
momentum strategy period and the control strategy pair computed after
1,000 simulations. Again, by comparing momentum Sharpe ratios in Panel
A against control strateg y Sharpe ratios in Panel B, we can see that
momentum Sharpe ratios are above the 99.5 percent percentile of the
empirical distribution for 6 and 12 month periods.

CONCLUSION
The momentum strategy is the most famous anomaly arguing against the
hypothesis of ﬁnancial market efﬁciency. The momentum strategy produces
a signiﬁcant abnormal return for holding periods of six months and one
year using ﬁnancial futures (stock indexes, currencies, and ﬁxed income).
Furthermore, this study characterizes those futures contracts that contribute to the momentum strategy return. When the sample is split in two
groups depending on the level of volatility, a signiﬁcantly higher return is
obtained in the high volatility group. Moreover, when the sample of futures
is split into four groups, depending on the trading volume and open interest
levels, those contracts with high trading volume and low open interest
report the best momentum performance. Finally, we have tested if those
momentum strategies with average returns that are signiﬁcantly different to
zero continue being positive and signiﬁcantly different to zero after a

risk-adjustment is introduced. A one-factor CAPM correction and the
Fama and French (1993) three-factor model (not reported due to space
restrictions) showed that risk-adjusted momentum returns were positive,
but smaller, and signiﬁcantly different to zero for 6- and 12-month periods. Therefore, the traditional tests can only partially explain momentum
strategy returns. Furthermore, we have randomly simulated the momentum return average 1,000 times in order to obtain the distributional
properties of this strategy. Results are very positive for 6- and 12-month
periods as the mean and Sharpe ratios are above the 99.5 percentile of the
empirical distribution. This result adds more evidence for considering
momentum returns as abnormally high.

ABSTRACT
This chapter studies how the optimal trading strategy differs across market
structures. An important component of the order placement strategy is the
choice between limit orders and market orders. Our analysis has several
speciﬁc implications for trading strategies in continuous order-driven markets and call auctions. First, in continuous order-driven markets, high
volatility days, or high volatility stocks make it convenient to use limit
orders. Second, in continuous order-driven markets, relatively patient
(eager) traders place limit (market) orders. Third, in call auctions, executed
orders receive price improvement. Fourth, in call auctions, traders are more
aggressive since they will not pay the aggressive price, but they will beneﬁt
from it in terms of higher probability of execution.

INTRODUCTION
The basic choices that a trader has to make refers to the type (i.e., to trade
via limit orders, market orders, or a combination of both), size, and timing
of the orders that he or she is going to use to trade. This set of choices is
83

84

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

called order placement strategy. In this chapter, we study how the optimal
trader’s order placement strategy differs across market structures.
Markets use trading rules to arrange trades. As Harris (2003) points out,
order precedence rules (OPRs) serve to match buyers and sellers, and trade
pricing rules (TPRs) set the execution price. OPRs rank all buy and sell
orders in order of increasing precedence and determine who will trade.
Most markets use the price priority rule as primary OPR and the time
precedence rule as secondary OPR. The trade pricing rules (TPRs) depend
on the type of market. Call auctions use the uniform pricing rule and all
trades take place at the same market clearing price. By contrast, continuous
order-driven markets use the discriminatory pricing rule and trades take
place at different prices. Trading strategies that are successful in one market
may work poorly in a market with different trading rules. This implies that
traders need to design their trading strategies conditioned upon the rules of
the market where they trade. In this chapter we present several implications
for trading strategies developed on the basis of the trading rules that govern
continuous order-driven markets and call auctions.

COSTS AND BENEFITS OF LIMIT
ORDER TRADING
The order placement strategy depends on the relative merits and costs of
limit orders and market orders (Harris, 1998). Let us ﬁrst consider the costs
and beneﬁts from placing limit orders.
Limit order traders bear t wo t ypes of risks and costs (Handa and
Schwartz, 1996). First, the risk of adverse informational change is known as
ex-post regret or winner’s curse. This risk materializes when the market price
moves against the limit order trader. Bearish news may cause the price of the
stock to fall and the trader’s buy limit order to execute or, equivalently, bullish news may cause the price of the stock to rise and the trader’s sell limit
order to execute. In both cases the trader will regret the execution. Second,
the risk of limit order not executing (i.e., nonexecution risk) is a potential cost
for limit order traders. This risk also depends on the price dynamics. Bullish
news may cause the price of the stock to rise and the trader’s buy limit order
not to execute. Bearish news may cause the price of the stock to fall and the
trader’s sell limit order not to execute. From this discussion it seems that the
limit order trader faces a situation like “Heads you win . . . tails I lose,” since

chapter 6 Order Placement Strategies in Different structures

he or she gets the execution but regrets it or he or she correctly forecasts the
price movement but does not get the execution.
Therefore, why should a trader place a limit order? Let us consider the
beneﬁts associated with limit order trading. The main advantage of using
limit orders is the better price that results from limit order execution.
Buyers who submit limit orders hope to buy at the bid. If they had submitted a buy market order instead, they would have paid the ask price (which is
strictly higher than the bid). Sellers who submit limit orders hope to sell at
the ask price. If they had submitted a sell market order instead, they would
have received the bid price (which is strictly lower than the ask price).
However, limit order traders do not always realize their expectations. Limit
order traders receive better prices only if their order actually trades. If the
market moves away from their limit price, they may never trade. If they still
want to trade, they will have to “chase the price” by raising their bid or
lowering their offer. For example, if the market price goes up and a buy
limit order is not executed, the trader will have to raise the limit order’s bid
or to use a market order. This would make the ﬁnal purchase price actually
worse than the price that the trader would have obtained had he or she used
market orders at the time of the ﬁrst limit order submission.
Limit order execution depends on price dynamics as well and, speciﬁcally, limit orders get executed when a liquidity event occurs (Anolli and
Petrella, 2007). A liquidity event is the arrival of a trader on the other side
of the market who is buying liquidity (and is not an informed trader). In
other words, the trader posted a buy limit order and an impatient seller
arrived or the trader posted a sell limit order and an impatient buyer
arrived. Alternatively, one can look at the same event as “mean reversion”
in the pricing process: the trader posted a buy limit order and the price
ﬁrst went down and then up or the trader posted a sell limit order and the
price ﬁrst went up and then down. Based on this result, if we reconsider
the question “Why should a trader place a limit order?”, the answer might
be stated in an alternative way: because the trader expects that sufﬁcient
mean reversion would offset the costs that might result from an informational change. This implies that the gain from limit order trading depends
on the intraday volatility level. Mean reversion is usually associated with
accentuated intraday transitory volatility. To measure the extent of this
characteristic it is necessary to estimate the stock return autocorrelation
(or serial correlation), that is the correlation of the return of stock i at time

85

86

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

t with the return of stock i at time t  1. Positive autocorrelation means
that positive returns tend to be followed by positive returns and negative
returns tend to be followed by negative returns (i.e., neighboring returns
tend to have the same sign). Negative autocorrelation means that positive
returns tend to be followed by negative returns and negative returns tend
to be followed by positive returns (i.e., neighboring returns tend to have
different signs). Negative short-run serial correlation is evidence of accentuated intraday mean reversion and creates ideal market conditions to submit limit orders (since the risk of nonexecution drops). In fact, intraday
volatility is a natural property of order-driven markets (Handa, Schwartz,
and Tiwari, 1998). Without intraday volatilit y, traders would not ﬁnd
proﬁtable to submit limit orders.
The cost-beneﬁt ratio of trading via limit orders depends on the type of
volatility that the market exhibits (Foucault, 1999). Stock return volatility
can either be permanent or transitory. Permanent volatility refers to the
change in price motivated by the arrival of new information. A new piece of
information makes the change in the stock value “permanent” and is known
as efﬁcient volatility because if the market is informationally efﬁcient, the
price must reﬂect the information as soon as it is available. This is the type
of volatility that limit order traders would like to avoid. By contrast, transitory volatility refers to price movements that will be quickly reverted.
Transitory volatility is generated by traders demanding liquidity and the
price bouncing back and forth between bid and ask quotes which is also
called inefﬁcient volatility since such price movements do not improve to
the price discovery process. This is the volatility that limit order traders
would like to ﬁnd. Trading by liquidity traders creates transitory volatility
and trading by momentum traders reinforces it. By contrast, trading by
informed traders creates permanent volatility since they move the price to
the new equilibrium level.

TRADING IN A CONTINUOUS
ORDER-DRIVEN MARKET
Trading in a limit order book takes place when a standing limit order (i.e.,
a limit order waiting for execution) matches a market order or a marketable limit order from the opposite side of the market. Any trader needs
to choose whether to place a limit order or to submit a market order.

chapter 6 Order Placement Strategies in Different structures

Additionally, if the trader uses a limit order, he also needs to set the limit
price. The decision whether to submit a market or a limit order in a continuous order-driven market is made with respect to the gains from trading and the probabilit y of limit order execution (Horrigan and Wald,
2005). Limit order trading involves the risk of nonexecution but also
offers the promise of lower execution costs (i.e., superior returns). If executed, a buy (sell) limit order would pay (receive) a lower (higher) price.
However, limit order execution is uncertain, whereas a market order
would be executed with certainty. The certainty of market order execution comes with increased transaction costs: a buy (sell) market order
would pay (receive) a higher (lower) price. A trader chooses between limit
and market orders based on the expected pay-offs of each trading strategy. A trading strategy based on market orders consumes liquidity and
pays the bid-ask spread, whereas one based on limit orders provides liquidit y and earns the bid-ask spread. The trade price associated with a
limit order strategy is superior to that associated with a market order
strategy. In fact, limit orders—provided that they get execution—buy at
the bid and sell at the ask price, whereas market orders buy at the ask and
sell at the bid.
More formally, the pay-off of a trading strategy depends on the trader’s
reservation price or target price (rp), the trade execution price (tp), and the
probability of order execution ( p). Given that the execution is certain, the
expected gain for a market order strategy (E[πMO]) is
⎧⎪( rp − tp ) if
E ⎡⎣π MO ⎤⎦ = ⎨
⎩⎪( tp − rp ) if

buy order
sell order

(6.1)

Since market orders execute against the best quotes on the opposite side
of the market, the previous equation becomes
⎧⎪ p ( rp − b ) if
E ⎡⎣π LO ⎤⎦ = ⎨
⎪⎩ p ( a − rp ) if

buy order
sell order

(6.2)

where a indicates the best ask quote and b the best bid quote.
For the limit order strategy, the pay-off is computed as for the market order
route, with two important differences. First, to compute the expected gain
it is necessary to take into account the probability of limit order execution.

87

88

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

Second, the execution price associated with a limit order strategy is strictly
better than that associated with the market order strategy. The expected gain
for a limit order strategy (E[πLO]) is
⎧⎪ p ( rp − b ) if
E ⎡⎣π LO ⎤⎦ = ⎨
⎩⎪ p ( a − rp ) if

buy order
sell order

(6.3)

The break-even conditions for buy and sell orders between market order
and limit order strategies can be stated as follows
( rp − a ) = p( rp − b ) if

buy order

( b − rp ) = p( a − rp ) if

sell order

(6.4)

Based on Equation 6.4—which in turn is based on Equation 6.1, Equation 6.2, and Equation 6.3—it is possible to derive a break-even probability
as the probability value that equates the expected gains associated with limit
order placement and market order submission. The break-even probability
( pBE) for a buy order is
pBE =

rp − a rp − b − s
s
= 1−
=
rp − b
rp − b
rp − b

(6.5)

where s indicates the bid-ask spread.
Equation 6.5 can be used to decide the best trading strategy by comparing the break-even probability of limit order execution with the actual
probability of limit order execution. If the break-even probability is higher
than the actual, it is preferable to submit a market order, otherwise a limit
order would be preferable. Equation 6.5 also implies that the higher the
reservation price is, the higher the break-even probability, and the more
appropriate is to place a market order. In fact, as the reservation price
increases, the differential gain between limit order and market order vanishes. Additionally, Equation 6.5 implies that the higher is the bid-ask
spread, the lower is the break-even probability, and the less suitable is to
use a market order since it would imply a largely inferior execution price
with respect to a limit order strategy.
The probability of limit order execution strongly affects the expected
gain from limit order trading and, consequently, the choice between limit
and market orders. Five factors affect the probability of limit order execution (Holliﬁeld, Miller, and Sandas, 2004): the aggressiveness of the limit

chapter 6 Order Placement Strategies in Different structures

price, the depth of the book, the rate of market orders, the duration of the
order, and the volatility of stock returns. First, for buy orders, the higher
the limit price, the higher the probability of execution; for sell orders, the
lower the limit price, the higher the probability of execution. Second, the
larger the size of depth on the buy (sell) side, the lower the probability of
execution for a buy (sell) limit order. Third, the larger the arrival rate of a
market order on the opposite side of the market, the higher the probability
of execution for a limit order. Fourth, the longer the duration of the limit
order, the higher the probability of execution. Fifth, the larger the price
volatility, the higher the probability of execution for a limit order, which
does not imply that order execution will be proﬁtable; it simply implies that
higher volatility entails higher probability of execution. Execution is profitable for a limit order trader if the volatility that triggered the limit order
execution is temporary. Execution is unproﬁtable for a limit order trader if
the volatility that triggered the limit order execution is permanent.
Three implications arise from the previous discussion. First, high volatilit y days or high volatilit y stocks make convenient to use limit orders.
Traders might even place limit orders on both sides of the market, acting as
market makers, to beneﬁt from accentuated intraday volatility (Petrella,
2006). Second, relatively patient traders place limit orders. This strategy is
usually called passive trading strategy (PTS). Large investors may prefer
PTS because this strategy does not cause market prices to change (due to
market impact) as the orders are naturally absorbed by the market. Third,
relatively eager traders place market orders. In a dynamic setting, a trader
might deﬁne an order placement strategy where he ﬁrst uses limit orders
(as a patient trader) and then switches to market orders (that is, he becomes
impatient) to trade the quantity associated with unexecuted limit orders.

TRADING IN A CALL AUCTION
In a call auction, multiple orders are batched together periodically for a
simultaneous execution (Economides and Schwartz, 1995). At the time of
the call, a market clearing price that maximizes the tradable quantity is
determined and applied to execute all matchable orders. In a continuous
order-driven market, trades are made whenever matchable buy and sell
orders happen to cross. By contrast, in a call auction, trades are made at
speciﬁc points in time when the market clearings are held (e.g., at the open,
at the close, and/or at speciﬁc times during the trading day).

89

90

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

Call auctions differ from continuous order-driven markets along three
dimensions. First, in terms of immediacy, waiting time (execution speed) is
lower (higher) in continuous markets. Second, in terms of price discovery,
prices in call markets are better than in continuous markets. Prices are
highly volatile in continuous markets because of news (efﬁcient volatility)
and order imbalance (inefficient volatilit y). Traders get their orders
executed depending on the current market conditions at the time of the
submission. By contrast, in a call auction, the terms of the trade depends on
the cumulative market conditions at the end of the preopening phase. This
implies that a transitory order imbalance might be easily wiped out in a call
auction by orders arriving from the opposite side of the market and thus
reducing inefﬁcient volatility (i.e., temporary price swings). Third, in terms
of trading volume, volume is higher in continuous markets. Some traders
that do not get execution in a call market, may execute their trades in a
continuous market (with zero surplus) if, on the opposite side of the market,
there are impatient traders demanding liquidit y. In short, continuous
markets sacriﬁce surplus (i.e., expected proﬁts) for immediacy, whereas call
auctions sacriﬁce immediacy for a better price discovery process.
Trading in a call auction is only apparently equivalent to trading in a
continuous market. Orders entered in a call auction are executed according
to the standard price priority rule followed by the time priority rule, just as
in continuous order-driven markets. However, limit and market orders are
handled differently in call and continuous trading and, consequently, they
should be submitted differently.
The operation of a call auction has two main implications for the design
of trading strategies. First, executed orders receive price improvement in a
call auction (Schwartz, Francioni, and Weber, 2006). In fact, there is no
bid-ask spread in a call auction because all executed orders clear at the same
price. Almost all executed orders receive price improvement (or positive
surplus or positive expected proﬁts). Precisely, buy orders priced above the
single clearing price and sell orders priced below it receive price improvement. Only orders priced exactly at the clearing price do not receive price
improvement. Second, traders are more aggressive in a call auction. In a
continuous market, limit orders provide immediacy and set the prices,
whereas market orders demand immediacy and accept limit orders prices.
The limit price affects the probability of execution and sets the price. In a
call market, all participants wait until the market will be “called” and all
orders executed simultaneously. Both limit order and market order traders

chapter 6 Order Placement Strategies in Different structures

supply liquidity to each other. The market clearing price will be determined
by the equilibrium between the overall demand and the overall supply. The
limit price affects the probability of execution, but it does not set the price
(although it does affect the market clearing price). Precisely, the impact of
an order on the clearing price depends on the size of the order with respect
to the rest of the market. If such order is small in size, it will not affect the
clearing price. The previous discussion implies that, in a call auction, a
trader has a strong incentive to place an aggressively priced order since he
will not pay the aggressive price for the stock, because the clearing price
will be set by the overall demand and supply, but he will beneﬁt from such a
price that will be used to set the orders that will be executed in the call auction according to the price priority rule.

CONCLUSION
In this chapter, we study how the optimal trader’s strategy differs across
market structures. The choice between limit orders and market orders is an
important component of the order placement strategy. Limit orders supply
liquidity to the markets because they provide other traders an opportunity
to trade at speciﬁed conditions (i.e., the limit price). By placing a limit order,
a trader enters in a position that is comparable to a short option position.
A buy limit order, e.g., is equal to a short position in an American-style put
option as the trader extends to anyone in the market the right to sell a
certain number of shares (equal to the size of the order) at a certain price
(equal to the limit price of the order). By contrast, market orders demand
liquidity because they consume the liquidity offered by limit orders. The
choice between limit orders and market orders depends on the gains from
trading and the probability of execution.
Our analysis highlights several implications for trading strategies in
continuous order-driven markets and call auctions. In a continuous orderdriven market, the gains from trading by limit orders depend on the size of
the bid-ask spread. The larger is the bid-ask spread, the larger is the beneﬁt for a limit order trader, if the limit order executes. In a call auction,
there is no bid-ask spread and almost all executed orders receive price
improvement.
As for the probability of execution, in a continuous order-driven market, the probability of limit order execution depends on the limit price and
market conditions. A more aggressive price increases the probability of

91

92

Pa rt i E X E C U T ION A ND MOM EN T U M T R A DING

execution, but it lowers the beneﬁt of limit order trading. As for the market conditions, if prices are moving to a new level (permanent volatility),
the trader should use a market order and settle for the current price;
whereas, if prices are ﬂuctuating around and will revert back to a previous
level (transitory volatility), the trader should be patient and use a limit
order. In a call auction, limit prices determine the precedence and (may)
affect the market clearing price, but they are not execution prices. Consequently, limit order traders are more aggressive in call auctions since they
will not pay the aggressive price, but they will beneﬁt from it in terms of
higher probability of execution.

Proﬁtability
of Technical
Trading Rules
in an Emerging
Market
Dimitris Kenourgios and Spyros Papathanasiou

ABSTRACT
This chapter investigates the proﬁtability of technical trading rules in the
Athens Stock Exchange (ASE), utilizing the FTSE/ASE 20 index during
the period 1995 to 2008. We focus on a less developed and efﬁcient stock
market, given the existing scarcity of research in such markets. The technical rules that will be explored are simple moving averages. We compare
technical trading strategies in the spirit of Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron
(1992), employing traditional t test and bootstrap methodology under the
generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticit y model. The
results provide strong evidence on the proﬁtability of the technical trading
rules against the “buy and hold” strategy and contradict the efﬁcient market
hypothesis.

INTRODUCTION
This chapter explores the proﬁtabilit y of simple technical rules in the
Athens Exchange Market (ASE) and particularly for the FTSE/ASE
20 index. The FTSE/ASE 20 is the most important index of the ASE and
represents the 20 companies with the largest capitalization. The technical
trading rules that we use to evaluate the proﬁtability of technical analysis
against the buy and hold strategy (benchmark) are variations of the simple
moving average rule.
Technical analysis forecasts the future direction of prices through the
study of past market data, primarily price, and volume. In its simplest form,
technical analysis considers only the actual price and volume behavior of the
market. Moving averages help traders to track the trends of ﬁnancial assets
by smoothing out the day-to-day price ﬂuctuations, or noise. Although the
majority of the professional traders and investors use technical analysis,
most academics, until recently, had not recognized the validity of these
methods.
Technical anomalies are observed in most developed and developing markets, leading traders and investors to earn signiﬁcant abnormal returns.
This chapter investigates these anomalies which appear to be in contrast
with the efﬁcient market hypothesis (EMH). A ﬁnancial market can be considered as efﬁcient if prices fully reﬂect all available information and no
proﬁt opportunities are left unexploited (Fama, 1965, 1970; Fama and
French, 1988). The agents form their expectations rationally and rapidly
arbitrage away any deviations of the expected returns consistent with
supernormal proﬁts. Therefore, it is the EMH and the random walk theory
versus practice.
The methodology that is employed for the analysis of the data is the
traditional t test, which has been used in many prior studies for the investigation of technical anomalies (e.g., Brown and Jennings, 1989; Neftci,
1991; Gençay, 1998). In addition, we compare the t test results with those
obtained by bootstrap methodology. Bootstrapping, introduced by Efron
(1979), is a method for estimating properties of an estimator (such as its
variance) by measuring those properties when sampling from an approximating distribution. One standard choice for an approximating distribution
is the empirical distribution of the observed data. In the case where a set
of observations can be assumed to be from an independent and identically

c h a p t e r 7 TE C H N IC A L T R A DING R U LES i n E m e r g i n g M a r k e t s

distributed population, this can be implemented by constructing a number
of resamples of the observed dataset (and of equal size to the observed
dataset), each of which is obtained by random sampling with replacement
from the original dataset. Following bootstrap methodology, we use the
returns generated from the pseudo ASE series and we apply the trading
rules to the series. Therefore, comparisons are then made between returns
from these simulated series and the original ASE series.
Among the international studies examining the technical anomalies,
Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron (1992), hereafter BLL (1992), investigate two popular trading rules (moving average and trading range break
rule), utilizing the Dow Jones Index from 1897 to 1986. Overall, their
results provide strong support for the technical strategies. Kwon and
Kish (2002) provide an empirical analysis on technical trading rules (the
simple moving average, the momentum, and trading volume), utilizing
the NYSE value-weighted index over the period 1962 to 1996. Their
results indicate that the technical trading rules can capture proﬁt opportunities over a buy-hold strategy. In addition, Wong, Manzur, and Chew
(2003) examine the role of technical analysis in signaling the timing of
stock market entry and exit for the Singapore stock market. They test
the performance of moving average and the relative strength index and
ﬁnd that the applications of technical indicators provide substantial profits. Further, Atmeh and Dobbs (2006) investigate the performance of
various moving average rules in the Jordanian stock market. Their results
show that technical trading rules can help to predict market movements,
and there is some evidence that (short) rules may be profitable after
allowing for transactions costs.
The research on technical anomalies for the Athens Stock Exchange is
still very limited. Vasiliou, Eriotis, and Papathanasiou (2008a) examine the
performance of various types of technical trading rules in the Athens Stock
Exchange, during the period 1995 to 2005. In particular, this study examines the predictability of daily returns using various moving averages rules
for the Athens General Index. Their results provide strong support for the
examined technical strategies. Vasiliou, Eriotis, and Papathanasiou (2008b)
apply technical analysis methodology into the behavior theory for the large
capitalization ﬁrms of the ASE from 1995 to 2005. Using standard and
more complicated tests, they provide evidence of a strong increase in trading rules performance over time.

This study is signiﬁcant for three reasons. First, it focuses on a less
developed and efﬁcient stock market, given the existing paucity of research
in such markets. Second, in contrast to prior relevant studies, it examines
the proﬁtability of technical trading rules after considering transaction
costs imposed to the participants in the ASE. Finally, traders would beneﬁt
from this research, as they will ﬁnd that these technical rules work in the
ASE and are deﬁnitely proﬁtable, since they have been tested with statistical
and more advanced econometric methods.
The structure of this chapter is organized as follows: The second section
of this chapter analyzes methodological issues. The third section presents
the data and the empirical ﬁndings of the research. The ﬁnal section contains the concluding remarks.

METHODOLOGY
In order to evaluate the performance of simple moving averages, we compare the returns given by the buy signals of the moving average with the
returns of the buy and hold strategy. In addition, we compare the returns
given by the buy signals of the moving average minus the returns of the sell
signals of the moving average with the returns of the buy and hold position.
We then calculate the returns after transaction costs. All transactions
assume commission as entry and exit fees (0.2 percent of the investing
capital).
First, we examine whether moving averages produce better results than
the buy and hold strategy using the standard t test. Moving averages give buy
signal when the short-term moving average crossover the long-term one. On
the other side, we have a sell signal when the long-term moving average
crossover the short-term one. Historically, moving average crossovers tend to
lag the current market action.
We use t test in order to assess if the means of two data groups are
statistically different from each other in order to compare these means. We
calculate the t statistic using the following formulas:

µ buys ( sells ) − µ buy&hold
(

σ2
σ2
+
)
Ν observ. Ν buys ( sells )

(7.1)

c h a p t e r 7 TE C H N IC A L T R A DING R U LES i n E m e r g i n g M a r k e t s

µ buys − µ sells
(

σ2
σ2
+
)
Ν buys Ν sells

(7.2)

where σ2 is the square root of the standard deviation of the returns, µ is the
mean return for the buys, sells, and buy and hold position, and N is the
number of signals for the buys, sells, and observations.
Using t tests, we compare the mean returns of the unconditional buy
methodology with the returns of the buy signals given by the moving averages
and the returns of the unconditional buy methodology with the returns of the
buy signals minus the returns of the sell signals given by the moving averages.
The results provided by the t test will help to either accept the null hypothesis
(there is no actual difference between mean returns) or reject it (there is an
actual difference between the mean returns).
It is well known that the results obtained by t test assume independent,
stationary, and asymptotically normal distributions. However, it is quite
common that ﬁnancial time series exhibit non-normality based on excessive
skewness, kurtosis, and heteroskedasticity. Following BLL (1992), we overcome these statistical problems adopting the bootstrap technique. Bootstrap
is a computer-based resampling procedure introduced by Efron (1979),
which has been discussed in the statistics and econometrics literature over
the past 20 years (e.g., Efron, 1987; Freedman and Peters, 1984a, 1984b;
Veall, 1992). This method requires no analytical calculations and the procedure uses only the original data for resampling to access the unobservable
sampling distribution and to provide a measure of sampling variability, bias,
and conﬁdence intervals. Efron and Tibshirani (1986) propose that the use
of the bootstrap enlarges the t ype of statistical problem that can be
analyzed, reduces the assumptions required to validate the analyses, and
eliminates the tedious theoretical calculations associated with the assessment
of accuracy.
The idea behind the bootstrap is to use resampling to estimate an
empirical distribution for the statistic. The procedure of the bootstrap
methodology is the following: First, we create Z bootstrap samples, each
consisting of N observations by sampling with replacement from the original return series. Second, we calculate the corresponding price series for
each bootstrap sample, apply the moving average rule to each of the
Z artiﬁcial price-series and calculate the performance statistic of interest

101

102

Pa rt i I TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

for each of the pseudo price series. Finally, we determine the p value by
calculating the number of times the statistic from the pseudo series exceed
the statistic from the original price series. In order to use the bootstrap
method, a data generating process for market prices or returns must be
speciﬁed a priori. The bootstrap method can be used to generate many different return series by sampling with replacement from the original return
series. The bootstrap samples created are pseudo return-series that retain
all the distributional properties of the original series, but are purged of any
serial dependence.
Financial time series usually exhibit a characteristic known as volatility
clustering, in which large changes tend to follow large changes, and small
changes tend to follow small changes. In either case, the changes from one
period to the next are typically of unpredictable sign. Volatility clustering,
or persistence, suggests a time-series model in which successive disturbances, although uncorrelated, are nonetheless serially dependent.
To account for the phenomenon of volatility clustering, which is very
common in financial time series, the model we use is the generalized
autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, or GARCH (1,1), model,
proposed initially by Engle (1982) and further developed by Bollerslev
(1986). The speciﬁcation of the GARCH (1,1) model is the following:
rt = γ + δ rt −1 + ε t

σ t2 = ω + αε t2−1 + βσ t2−1

(7.3)

where r is the return of the stock index, σ 2 is the variance, the residuals εt
are conditionally normally distributed with zero mean and conditional
variance (σ2), and the standardized residuals are independent and identically
distributed N(0,1). The variance equation is a function of three terms: the
mean ω, news about volatility from the previous period, measured as the lag
2
of the squared residual from the mean εt1
equation (α is the ARCH term),
2
and last period’s forecast variance σ t1 (β is the GARCH term). The sum of
ARCH and GARCH coefﬁcients (α  β ) indicates the degree of persistence
in volatility. Values of (α  β ) close to unity imply that the persistence in
volatility is high.
In order to use bootstrap under GARCH (1,1), we ﬁrst estimate the
GARCH (1,1) by using maximum likelihood and apply the bootstrap
method on the standardized residuals. Then produce GARCH series by
using the estimated parameters and the crumbled residuals. In this chapter,

c h a p t e r 7 TE C H N IC A L T R A DING R U LES i n E m e r g i n g M a r k e t s

each of the simulations is based on 500 replications of the null model,
which should provide a good approximation of the return distribution
under the null model.
To test the signiﬁcance of the trading rule excess returns, the following
hypothesis can be stated:
−

H 0 : XR ≤ XR *
_

(7.4)

H 1 : XR  XR *
Under the null hypothesis (H0), the trading rule excess return (XR) calculated from the original series is less than or equal to the average trading
–
rule return for the pseudo data samples (X R*). The p values from the bootstrap procedure are then used to determine whether the trading rule excess
returns are signiﬁcantly greater than the average trading rule return given
that the true data-generating process is GARCH (1,1).

DATA AND EMPIRICAL RESULTS
In this study, we use daily closing prices of the FTSE/ASE 20 index from
1/1/1995 to 31/12/2008. The database used is composed of 3,249 observations. The FTSE/ASE 20 index is one of the most famous indexes of the
ASE and includes the 20 companies with the largest capitalization. The
requirements for the ﬁrms to participate in this index are the capitalization,
marketability, and the free-ﬂoat. The index of the Athens Stock Exchange
was designed with the cooperation of the London Stock Exchange and
FTSE International Limited.
We evaluate the performance of the following moving average rules
against the buy and hold strateg y: (1,9), (1,15), (1,30), (1,60), (1,90),
(1,120), and (1,150). The ﬁrst number in each pair indicates the days in the
short period and the second number shows the days in the long period.

Standard Statistical Results
Table 7.1 reports some summary descriptive statistics for the daily returns
of the FTSE/ASE 20 index. We calculate the returns as log differences of
the FTSE/ASE 20 level. We observe that the returns exhibit excessive
(lepto) kurtosis and non-normality.

The JB statistic is Jarque and Bera’s (1987) test for normality, being distributed
as x2 with 2 degrees of freedom under the null of normal distribution.

Table 7.2 presents the results using simple moving average trading strategies. The rules differ by the length of the short and long period. For example, (1,60) indicates that the short period is one day and the long period is 60
days. We report the number of buy “N(Buy)” and sell “N(Sell)” signals generated during the period in columns 3 and 4. The mean buy and sell daily
returns are reported separately in columns 5 and 6, while column 7 lists the
differences between the mean buy and sell daily returns (“Buy/Sell”). These
tests are computed using the BLL (1992) method.
We observe in column 7 that the buy/sell differences are signiﬁcantly
positive for all rules. This leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis
(equality with zero). The mean buy/sell returns are all positive with an
average daily return of 0.0987 percent. This is 24.675 percent on a year
basis (250 trading days  0.0987 percent).
The mean buy returns are all positive with an average daily return
of 0.0669 percent. This is 16.725 percent on a year basis (250 trading days
 0.0669 percent). The t statistics reject the null hypothesis since the mean
return of the buy and hold position is 0.020439 percent (see Table 7.1). Six
of the seven tests reject the null hypothesis that the returns equal the
unconditional returns at the 5 percent signiﬁcance level using a two-tailed
test. About the sells, the daily average return is 0.00318 percent. This is
7.95 percent on a year basis. All the tests also reject the null hypothesis at
the 5 percent signiﬁcance level.

N(Buy) and N(Sell) are the number of buy and sells signals generated by the rule.
In columns 5, 6, and 7, the number in parentheses are standard t statistics, testing the difference between the mean
buy return and the unconditional mean return, the mean sell return and the unconditional mean return, and buy/sell
and zero, respectively.
The last row reports averages across all seven rules.
The upper (lower) critical values of the t test values are 1.96 at 5% level.

If technical analysis does not have any power to forecast price movements, then we should observe that returns on days when the rules emit
buy signals do not differ appreciably from returns on days when the rules
emit sell signals. In this chapter, we provide evidence that the technical
strategies used win the buy and hold strategy (FTSE /ASE 20). Overall,
the buy and hold strategy (see Table 7.1) gives 5.10975 percent annual
return (0.020439  250 days), while the strategy of simple moving averages 24.675 percent.

Bootstrap Results
Following BLL (1992) methodology, we create 500 bootstrap samples,
each consisting of 3,249 observations by resampling with replacement the

105

106

Pa rt i I TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

standardized residuals of the GARCH (1,1) model. Then, we generate
GARCH price-series by using the estimated parameters and the crumbled
residuals. After that, we apply the moving averages to each of the 500
pseudo price-series. Then, we determine the p value by calculating the
number of times the statistic from the artiﬁcial series exceeds the statistic
from the original price series (FTSE /ASE 20 index).
Table 7.3 presents the estimates of the GARCH (1,1) model. Based on
the Akaike Information Criterion, the Schwarz Criterion, and DickeyFuller and Phillips-Perron unit root tests, we ﬁnd that the GARCH (1,1)
model is well speciﬁed.1 Values of α  β close to unity imply that the persistence in volatilit y is high. In our case, the sum of the ARCH and
GARCH coefﬁcients (α  β) is very close to one indicating that volatility
shocks are very persistent.
Table 7.4 displays the results of GARCH (1,1) simulations using simple
moving average trading strategies via bootstrapping. We present results for
the seven moving average rules that we examine. All the numbers presented
in columns 4, 5, and 6 are the fractions of the simulated result which are
larger than the results for the original FTSE /ASE 20 index. We report the
mean buy and sell returns separately in columns 4 and 5. The results presented in columns 4, 5, and 6 are p values. The p values from the bootstrap
procedure are then used to determine whether the trading rule excess
returns (simple moving averages) are signiﬁcantly greater than the average
trading rule return given from original series. The numbers in parentheses
in columns 4, 5, and 6 show how many series from 500 replications are
greater than the original returns.

We create 500 bootstrap samples, each consisting of 3,249 observations by resampling with replacement the
standardized residuals of the GARCH (1,1) model.
The numbers presented in columns 4, 5, and 6 are the fractions of the simulated result which are larger than
the results for the original FTSE/ASE 20 index.
Results presented in the columns 4, 5, and 6 are p values.
The numbers in parentheses in columns 4, 5, and 6 show how many series from 500 replications are greater
than the original returns.

From Table 7.4 (columns 4, 5, and 6), we observe that most of the simulated GARCH (1,1) series are g reater than those from the original
FTSE/ASE 20 index of ASE series. For example, using the moving average
(1,9) rule, buy/sell position (column 6), 361 (from 500) of the simulated
GARCH series generate a mean return larger than that from the original
FTSE /ASE 20 index, which is 72 percent of the simulations. All the results
for buy, sell, and buy/sell positions are highly signiﬁcant, resulting in the
acceptance of the null hypothesis. This means that the trading rule excess
return (XR) calculated from the original series is less than or equal to the
–
average trading rule return for the pseudo data samples (X R*). Finally, our
results are consistent with BLL (1992) and in line with the existing

evidence on the proﬁtability of technical trading strategies in emerging and
less developed stock markets.

CONCLUSION
This chapter investigates the proﬁtability of technical trading rules in an
emerging market such as the Athens Stock Exchange. Particularly, we use
variations of simple moving averages for the FTSE/ASE 20 index, using
daily data for the period 1995 to 2008. Following the BLL (1992)
methodolog y, we evaluate the performance of seven moving averages
rules (1,9), (1,15), (1,30), (1,60), (1,90), (1,120), and (1,150) against
the buy and hold strateg y, using both standard tests and bootstrap
methodology.
Using t tests, we compare the mean returns of the unconditional buy
methodology with the returns of the buy signals given by the moving averages and the returns of the unconditional buy methodolog y with the
returns of the buy signals minus the returns of the sell signals given by the
moving averages. In this setup, we test the null hypothesis (there is no
actual difference between mean returns) against the alternative (there is an
actual difference between the mean returns). Using bootstrap methodology, we compare the returns conditional on buy (or sell) signals from the
actual FTSE/ASE 20 data with the returns from simulated comparison
series generated by a model from the null hypothesis class being tested.
The null model tested is the GARCH (1,1).
About the simple moving averages trading strategies, we ﬁnd that all
the buy/sell differences are positive. Also, all the t tests for the differences are highly signiﬁcant rejecting the null hypothesis (equality with
zero). In addition, the mean buy/sell returns are all positive with a daily
ret urn of 0.0987 percent in average (24.675 percent annual ret urn).
Overall, the results indicate that making trading decisions based on moving average rules lead to signiﬁcantly higher returns than the buy and
hold strategy, even after transaction costs. In addition, the results show
that technical rules produce useful signals and can help to predict market
movements. More speciﬁc, the proﬁtability of technical strategies such
as moving averages on large capitalization stocks is better than the
proﬁtability we get by simply following the market (buy and hold). In
particular, the buy and hold strateg y gives 5.10975 percent annual

c h a p t e r 7 TE C H N IC A L T R A DING R U LES i n E m e r g i n g M a r k e t s

return, while simple moving averages 24.675 percent (buy/sell) on an
annual basis. Using bootstrapping, the results are quite similar. Most of
the simulated GARCH (1,1) series are greater than those from the original FTSE/ASE 20 index of ASE series. Our results are in line with the
existing literat ure on the performance of technical trading rules in
emerging and less developed stock markets.
Our ﬁndings contradict to the efﬁcient market hypothesis as traders and
investors can gain abnormal returns using moving average trading strategies. Furthermore, our results (after transactions costs) are consistent with
the simple technical rules having predictive power. Finally, the proﬁtability
of the applied technical strategies in this chapter is veriﬁed by using econometrical and statistical methods. Our research indicates that the beneﬁts of
technical trading strategies, such as the prediction of price movements and
the identiﬁcation of trends and patterns, can be exploited by traders to earn
signiﬁcant returns on the ASE.

Testing Technical
Trading Rules as
Portfolio Selection
Strategies
Vlad Pavlov and Stan Hurn

INTRODUCTION
Technical analysis refers to the practice of using algorithms based solely on
current and historical stock returns or prices to generate buy and sell signals.
In other words, all information relating to perceived fundamental variables
driving stock prices, such as dividend payments, for example, is ignored. As
this approach to portfolio selection violates the market efﬁciency hypothesis
even in its weakest form ( Jensen, 1978), it is controversial, although it
remains in common use by market practitioners.
Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron (1992), hereafter BLL (1992), provide
a formal statistical framework for evaluating the performance of technical
analysis based investing strategies. BLL (1992) applied a number of moving
average and trading range rules to the Dow Jones Industrial Average over a
very long sample period. They constructed bootstrapped distributions of
trading proﬁts generated from a variety of data-generating processes and
found that the rules generated proﬁts in excess of what would be expected if
the return generating processes followed the assumptions of popular statistical models. The BLL (1992) findings were particularly remarkable
because every one of the 26 trading rules they considered was found to be
capable of outperforming the buy and hold benchmark. A large number of
113

subsequent studies have shown similar results (see, inter alia, Levich and
Thomas, 1993; Osler and Chang, 1995; Hudson, Dempsey, and Keasey,
1996; Gençay, 1998; Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang, 2000).
In a signiﬁcant paper, Sullivan, Timmermann, and White (1999) identify
a subtle source of data-snooping bias in the BLL (1992) results. They point
out that the BLL universe of investment rules itself is an outcome of a prior
extensive speciﬁcation search by the investment community. They apply the
“reality check” due to White (2000) that takes into account the uncertainty
about the nature of proﬁtable trading rules and the parameters of these
rules. They examine nearly 8,000 parameterizations of trading rules using
the same data as BLL. Under White’s test the in-sample evidence in favor of
superior performance of technical trading rules appears much weaker.
Importantly, the analysis of an extended sample which includes post 1989
data, not available to BLL, shows no evidence of superior performance.
While certain trading rules do outperform the benchmark using the original
BLL sample (1897–1986), the rules were not found to be proﬁtable in a further 10 years’ out-of-sample data (1987–1996). Moreover, when short-sale
constraints and transaction costs were accounted for in the application of the
trading rules to contracts on the S&P 500 futures index, no evidence of
superior performance could be found.
This chapter proposes to examine the proﬁtability of trading rules on a
much larger set of data than a single stock market or currency index. The
idea is to apply technical trading rules to individual stocks and then form
portfolios based on the signals produced by the rules. In order to avoid the
data snooping bias, the entire distribution of returns over all trading rules
will be examined rather than trying to pick a particular set of trading rule
parameters. A bootstrapping exercise is then undertaken to examine if the
distribution of returns to technical rules is consistent with the distribution
of returns generated by drawing a portfolio randomly from the universe of
stocks (a “darts” portfolio).
The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. The second section of
this chapter describes the dataset employed, and the third section deals
with various methodological points related to the construction of portfolios based on buy and sell signals generated by moving average rules. The
performance of these portfolios is also illustrated. In this chapter’s fourth
section, the results obtained from implementing this investment strategy
are examined in more detail in terms of a bootstrapping exercise. Conclusions are contained in the ﬁfth and ﬁnal section of this chapter.

DATA
The data are taken from the Centre for Research in Finance (CRIF) database containing monthly observations on prices, returns, dividends and capital reconstructions for all corporate securities listed on the Australian
Stock Exchange (ASX). The analysis is performed on monthly returns
deﬁned as the sum of the capital gain and dividend yield, taking into
account any capital reconstructions.
The sample of ret urns covers the period from December 1973 to
December 2008. As a baseline for comparative purposes, Table 8.1
reports the means and standard deviations of returns for equally weighted
stocks in different size cohorts. Returns statistics in Table 8.1 are calculated under two different sets of assumptions about returns during the
periods of nontrading. In the ﬁrst set of statistics, the return for a size
cohort in each period is calculated as the average of only the stocks traded
during the current month. This effectively means that all nontraded
stocks are inferred with the average return based on all traded stocks in
the cohort.
In the second approach, the common treatment of missing observations,
especially when calculating an index return, namely that of setting the capital
gains on a nontraded stock to zero (effectively valuing the stock at the last
available market price) is adopted. Return statistics calculated using this
assumption are in columns 4 and 5 of Table 8.1.
As expected, inferring missing returns with zeros biases the estimate of
the mean return downward (a random stock is expected to provide a positive return). It also implies zero volatility for the periods of nontrading, so
the effect on the standard deviation estimates is intuitive. On the other
hand estimating the returns based on traded stocks only ignores exits and
de-listings which tend to be associated with distress (although stocks can
also exit the database due to mergers). For smaller stocks, in particular, an
exit from the database is often preceded by a period of low liquidity and
depressed returns. It is reasonable to expect that the mean return estimates
in the second column are biased upward and provide an upper bound of the
estimates of the underlying expected return.
Both sets of mean return and standard deviation estimates are close
(within 10 basis points) for stocks up to the 400 to 500 cohort and begin
diverging rather rapidly afterward. We conclude that the mean returns estimates become very sensitive to the treatment of missing returns and exits

PORTFOLIO FORMATION
One of the most popular technical trading rules is the moving average or
momentum rule.1 To implement the rule, two moving averages MAt (h1)
and MAt (h2) are constructed using averaging windows with lengths h1 and
h2. Trading signals are generated by crossovers; the moving average MAt
(h1) crossing the moving average from MAt (h2) below is interpreted as a
signal to take a long position in the stock, crossing from above triggers the
taking of a short position or the liquidation of a long position. Buy if:
MAt (h1)  MAt (h2), MAt1 (h1)  MAt1 (h2). Sell if: MAt (h1)  MAt (h2);
MAt1 (h1)  MAt1 (h2).
In the traditional (or momentum) interpretation of the rules h1  h2, so
that MAt(h1) involves a shorter averaging window and a more volatile moving average than MAt(h2). When this inequality is reversed (h1  h2), the

chapter 8 Testing Technical Trading Rules

rule will be referred to as contrarian. In this chapter, two types of moving
averages may be used in rule construction:
1. Simple moving average: MAt ( h ) =

1 0
∑ pt − j ;
h j =h−1

2. Exponentially weighted moving average: MAt(h)  h MAt1
(h)  (1h)pt
Rules based on simple averaging appear more common in industry and
especially academic practice. The motivation for considering exponentially
weighted moving average (EWMA) rules is to allow the averaging parameters to be continuously variable. This makes for dramatically different
results as will be demonstrated shortly. Figure 8.1 illustrates the operation of
the exponentially weighted momentum trading rule for a selected Australian
stock.

For a ﬁxed combination of parameters momentum portfolios are formed
using the following procedure. Trading signals are generated for every
month and each stock in the CRIF database over the available sample period.
Buy and sell signals are used to form arbitrage (or zero cost) portfolios by
purchasing all stocks which generate “buy” signals in a particular month
ﬁnancing this purchase by shorting the stocks for which “sell” signals have
been generated. If no buy or sell signals are generated in a particular month
the portfolio reverts to a neutral position (zero holdings of all stocks). If St,i
and Bt,i are deﬁned as the indicator functions for buy and sell signals respect ively (i.e., S t,i  1 if a sell sig nal is generated for the stock i at
time t and zero otherwise) and is the total number of stocks available for
investment at time t, then the arbitrage portfolio return is calculated as:

This arbitrage portfolio is held for one month and then sold, so the portfolio is turned over completely at the end of each month. An information coefﬁcient (IC) is deﬁned as the ratio of the mean return to standard deviation
and is a popular per formance measure for standalone port folios.
Two additional criteria are applied to stock selection to weed out thinly
traded securities. To be included in the long/short portfolio at time t, the
security must have no missing observations over the three years prior to
portfolio formation. In addition, it is assumed that investors can anticipate
short term de-listings, so that any stocks that exit the database in period
t  1 because they have been dropped from the ASX register are not
included in the portfolio. Since we concentrate on large stocks, this
assumption makes no material difference to the results as exits are relatively rare. The number of securities that pass the liquidity criteria each
month ranges between 273 and 411 with the average of 342 securities.
Figure 8.2 illustrates information coefﬁcients using one-month holding
returns on the arbitrage portfolio constructed using weighted moving averages for different combinations of h1 and h2. It is important to note that no
further optimizations have been applied and in particular the same moving
average parameters are used for all stocks. For comparison, Figure 8.3

shows the graph of information coefﬁcients for an arbitrage portfolio and
the parameters the rule for simple moving averages.
The difference is dramatic; prof its from rules constructed using
weighted averages display an almost deterministic dependence on parameters. The corresponding graph constructed using simple rules contains
much more noise. Another notable difference is that contrarian proﬁts
dominate the surface of the ICs constructed using EWMA rules; the IC
surface constructed using simple averaging show positive returns to the traditional momentum rule (i.e., long on downside up crossovers). This apparent contradiction is now examined in a little more detail.
In turns out that the resolution to this conundrum is to be found in the
provision of a more appropriate comparison between rules based on different
types of averaging. In particular, the parameters of simple MA rules may be
mapped onto the parameters of weighted MA rules by matching the corresponding return volatilities. Speciﬁcally, consider two moving averages: an
EWMA with the parameter h and a simple moving average with the averaging
window N. For a given window N, pick an EWMA parameter so that
the volatility of the weighted average is the same as the volatility of the simple
average. Using geometric returns and assuming stationarity in variance this
means choosing h to match

It can be shown after some manipulation that this means that h has to satisfy

What this quadratic relationship actually means is that the EWMA rules
magnify a small area in the southwest corner of the IC surface of the simple ret urns plotted in Figure 8.3. For example, the simple MA with
N  12 corresponds to the EWMA h  0.85. So the usable EWMA rules
effectively correspond to simple MA rules with up to one-year averaging
window.

chapter 8 Testing Technical Trading Rules

The surface plot of the information coefﬁcients for one-month holding
returns on arbitrage portfolios based on simple MA signals for different
combinations of volatility matched combinations of h1 and h2 is shown on
Figure 8.4. It is clear that the underlying relationship is very similar to the
one observed for the EWMA rules. The plot also identiﬁes the constrast
between the different forms of averaging. In particular, simple averaging
lacks resolutions at low values of the averaging parameters and hence for
more volatile trading rules. On the other hand, in the Australian dataset,
momentum rules appear to produce proﬁts at relatively large values of the
smoothing parameters of the long MA. With a ﬁxed grid, the EWMA rules
resolve this area relatively poorly.
A more fundamental problem with examining rules at large h values is
the very small number of trading signals that they produce. For example,
for h1,2  0.9, the average number of signals per period is less than 1, which
complicates statistical evaluation of the results. For this reason and also
because it appears to us that the contrarian proﬁts that we identify at short
averaging horizons have not been covered in the literature, we concentrate
on the exponentially weighted moving average rules.

BOOTSTRAP EXPERIMENT
No attempt is made to describe statistical tests of the parameters of the
momentum return distributions in this chapter. Instead we conduct a simple bootstrapping exercise in the spirit of one of the classic ﬁnance experiments by comparing the distribution of the arbitrage proﬁts from investing
in a momentum portfolio with the distribution of proﬁts from an arbitrage
(or zero cost) darts portfolio selected randomly from the available securities. The random portfolio is constructed as follows. For each month (t) we
note the number of securities included in the long (NL,t) and short (NS,t)
legs of the momentum portfolio. We then select NL,t and NS,t stocks at random from the population of all securities that in period t pass the liquidity
criterion (i.e., have an uninterrupted three-year trading history). Just as in
the momentum portfolio random securites in each leg are equally weighted.
For each combination of h1 and h2, we draw 10 such random portfolios conditional on the size of the momentum portfolio for 49,500 random draws in
total. We then save the mean and standard deviation of the return for each
random portfolio.
Figure 8.5 shows the histograms of the distribution for information
coefﬁcients for the combinations of (h 1, h 2) such that h 2  h 1 (i.e., the
contrarian interpretation of the rule) and the histogram of the information coefficients for random portfolios. The histogram based on the
momentum rule returns can be interpreted as a scaled estimate of the
proﬁt distribution for an investor with a uniform prior over the parameters of the momentum rule. While it may have been possible to think of a
more ﬁne-tuned prior or reﬁne the prior through a recursive learning
algorithm, the objective in this chapter is merely descriptive. We are trying to identify if the sample of securities selected by the full collection of
momentum rules is in some sense unusual or differs in a systematic way
from a random sample.
The distribution of information coefﬁcients for the momentum rules
is clearly bimodal. It also has a considerable overlap with the histogram
of information coefﬁcients for random portfolios. The reason for the
overlap is very simple. When the smoothing parameters of both moving
averages are small (h  0.3), the trading rule generates a very large number of signals. This means that both legs of the momentum portfolio
include large numbers of securities, most of the signals pick up noise in

the data and the rules provide very little selectivity. For these parameter
combinations, the arbitrage portfolio looks very much like a random
selection of securities. It is possible to rule out such combinations either
by manipulating the prior or imposing some restrictions on the portfolio
turnover, but as discussed previously, our a priori preference is to avoid
excessive manipulations of atheoretical parameters to avoid accusations of
data snooping.
The larger of the two modes is much more interesting. It clearly lies
well outside of the IC distribution for the darts portfolio. The 99 percentile of the darts distribution is 0.12 which compares to 0.16 for the
more extreme mode of the momentum distribution (the exact percentile of
the empirical darts distribution corresponding to the mode is 0.16 percent). Momentum portfolios could generate an appearance of proﬁts by

123

124

creating unusual exposures to systematic movements in stock returns. To
check this possibility we evaluted the exposures of the portfolio based on
the contrarian rule producing the extreme mode of the IC distribution
(the rule with the parameters h1  0.67, h2  0.16) using the conventional
three-factor model. The factors were constructed by ﬁrst sorting stocks
into portfolios based on 40 size cohorts and then using the principal components analysis on the unconditional correlation matrix to extract the
components. The justiﬁcation for this selection of factors is provided in
Hurn and Pavlov (2003).
Factor exposures were then evaluated by a series of rolling regressions.
To estimate the exposures the arbitrage portfolio is frozen based on
buy/sell signals at time t, then the return on this ﬁxed portfolio over three
years prior to portfolio formation were regressed on the realizations of the
factors. Figure 8.6 shows the time-series of rolling beta estimates. There
appears to be no obvious exposures to the factors or extreme observations.
The average risk exposures in particualar are not signiﬁcantly different
from zero. It is clear therefore that the proﬁts generated by the momentum
portfolios are not due to the trading rules introducing unusual exposures to
small or growth stocks.

CONCLUSION
The aggregate distribution of information coefﬁcients of momentum or
moving average trading rules across a wide range of parameter combinations with the corresponding distribution of randomly selected portfolios
has been compared. The moving average rules used here are appealing
because of their analytical simplicity; they are also still among the most
popular with technical analysis practitioners. This analysis identiﬁed two
main points. First, it appears that at least in the Australian data over the
period from 1973 to 2008 the returns on the momentum rules are strongly
contrarian over a one-month investment horizon. Second, there is an obvious mode of the return distribution which is very difﬁcult to explain by
alluding to pure chance selection. On its own, the analysis in this chapter
does not immediately lead to any speciﬁc trading rules or investment strategies based on moving average crossover rules. Rather, it suggests that at
least in some parameter subset these momentum rules appear to pick a systematic factor in returns which is not part of the “usual suspects” (e.g.,
market growth or size).

NOTES
1.

This interpretation of “momentum” in technical analysis differs from
the academic interpretation of the term which follows from the analysis
by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993). In this chapter we will use the term
momentum rules as interchangeable with moving average rules.

ABSTRACT
In this chapter we test whether technical analysis increases one’s chances of
beating the foreign exchange market. We apply pattern recognition techniques in order to identify points of market entry based on past history, and
consider a range of strategies represented by various combinations of stoploss and stop-limit orders using eight years of the daily foreign exchange
data for the world’s 10 major currency pairs. While we are unable to identify a universally winning strategy, our analysis supports the claim that, on
average, the application of technical trading rules results in the increased
probability of winning.

INTRODUCTION
Technical analysis is commonly understood as a set of rules used to predict
the future market movement based on the information on its past history.
In this chapter, we test whether two speciﬁc technical analysis trading rules
can increase the probability of beating the foreign exchange market.
While the subject has received substantial attention in the literature, the
focus appears to have been on challenging the weak form of the efﬁcient
market hypothesis (EMH), suggesting that all information about the
market’s past behavior is already incorporated in the current price, to use
the former for gaining any excess returns (Fama, 1970). As a recent review
of the literature on technical analysis in the foreign exchange markets by
Menkhoff and Taylor (2007) argues, technical analysis rules have been
enjoying a “widespread and continuous use” even if there is as yet no consensus among academics on its practical value. The generalized stylized fact
derived in this review on the basis of the received literature is that technical
analysis rules are normally used in conjunction with the fundamental analysis, performing better in the short run and with volatile currencies, but in
rather unstable a manner. Unstable performance here is understood in the
sense that it is impossible to identify a technical trading rule that would
result in consistent excess returns for all currency pairs and time periods.
Excess returns are computed after adjustments have been made for the
foregone interest rate, the extent of risk, and transaction costs (Menkhoff
and Taylor, 2007, Table 4).
In this chapter, we approach the issue of the performance of technical
analysis rules by asking ourselves a question: Does the application of technical
trading rules in the foreign exchange market increase the probability of one’s beating the market? We attempt to answer this question by estimating the empirical probabilities of enjoying positive and of suffering negative returns for a
large number of trading strategies based on the technical analysis charting
patterns and incorporating the fact that traders tend to limit their losses and
run their proﬁts by placing stop-loss and stop-limit orders (see, e.g., Bae,
Jang, and Park, 2003 on the stop-limit orders; Osler, 2005 on the stop-loss
orders). A stop-loss order is speciﬁed in terms of the number of points by
which the market has to move in the loss-making direction so that the position will be closed at a loss. Alternatively, a stop-limit order would specify at
what proﬁt in terms of the market points the position shall be closed. A
point is deﬁned as the minimum possible movement of an exchange rate, and

c h a p t e r 9 TE C H N IC A L T R A DING R U LES a n d w i n n i n g

is always normalized to one. For example, suppose the current exchange rate
of euro versus U.S. dollar is 1.3200 (i.e., 1 euro buys 1.3200 U.S. dollars). A
one-point deviation would result in the exchange rate becoming either
1.3201 or 1.3199. With the stop-loss value equal to 100 and the stop-limit
value equal to 300 points, the position will be closed at a loss if the exchange
rate at some point in time reaches the level of 1.3100, and proﬁts will be
made if the euro appreciates up to the level of 1.3500. We test for a large
number of strategies speciﬁed in terms of the technical analysis rules used to
identify points of entry as well as in terms of speciﬁc combinations of stoploss and stop-limit orders, and ﬁnd that on average such strategies do result
in positive returns, as opposed to the zero returns suggested by EMH.
However, we are unable to identify a set of strategies that would uniformly
result in positive proﬁts for all currency pairs.
This chapter is organized as follows. In the next section we introduce the
empirical methodology employed in this study. We then discuss our dataset
and empirical results. The ﬁnal section summarizes and concludes.

EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
We use daily closing exchange rates provided by the Forex Capital Markets
(FXCM, www.fxcm.com), for the period of January 1, 1999 to January 3,
2007. Since the global foreign exchange market operates round the clock,
the FXCM deﬁnes the closing exchange rate to be the one ﬁxed at 23:59:59,
New York (Eastern Standard) time.
We assume that a technical analysis rule is used as a decision rule to enter
the market. We employ pattern recognition techniques in order to identify
the entry points (i.e., we apply the “chartist” approach). We then assume
that a trader opens a position (e.g., buys euros for U.S. dollars) simultaneously with placing a stop-loss and a stop-limit order. The stop-loss order
speciﬁes a loss-limiting value, the stop-limit order speciﬁes a proﬁt-taking
value b. Once the exchange rate deviates from its value at the time of market
entry in the proﬁt-making direction by b points or more, the position is
closed, and the realized proﬁt is b. However, if it moves ﬁrst in the lossmaking direction by a points, the position is closed at a loss equal to a.
As mentioned in this chapter’s first section, the probabilit y of the
exchange rate moving by b points in the proﬁt-making direction before
a
moving by a points in the loss-making one, is
, making it impossible
(a + b)

to achieve any positive returns since the expected return in that case will be

E[ R ] = S × ⎢b ×
⎟⎥ = 0, where S is the size of the open
⎢⎣ a + b
⎝ a + b ⎠⎥⎦
position, and E[R] is the expected return.
In this chapter, we test whether entering the market as indicated by the
technical analysis rules increases the probability of the market moving in
the proﬁt-making direction, rendering E[R]  0. In other words, we test
whether entering the market by the technical trading rules changes the formula for expected return to E[R]  S  [b  p  a  (1  P)]  0 where

p >
a+b
We use two charting rules of technical analysis, namely, the bull and the
double bottom patterns, to enter the market. These two patterns are used for
opening a long position in the currency pair, i.e., indicating an upward market movement in the future. These charting patterns are relatively simple
compared with the other ones representing two major groups of technical
patterns, namely, the trend continuation and trend reversal patterns (Luca,
2000.) For example, the bull ﬂag is simpler to deﬁne and recognize compared with the head-and-shoulders or a triangle pattern. In the same way,
the double-top pattern is simpler than the triple-top or a diamond formation. In other words, we limit our analysis to the two characteristic representative patterns of the two major groups, also ignoring their “bearish”
counterparts.
In order to identify these charting patterns, we use the template-matching technique (Duda and Hart, 1973) used for the recognition of digital
images. The key to implementing this technique is the template onto which
the currency pair’s past exchange rates are superimposed in order to see
whether these past currency pair movements ﬁt a particular pattern. The
extent to which such a ﬁt occurs is measured by a statistic called ﬁtting
value, whose high values would indicate the chart pattern is strongly present, recommending entry into the market. Figure 9.1 represents a template
for the double-bottom and bull patterns signaling entry into the market.
Gray cells in the template represent the matched pattern (in our case,
the double-bottom in the left pane and bull in the right pane). We divide
the historical time window during which the pattern ﬁt is tested into 10
subperiods, each one corresponding to a speciﬁc column in the template.
Ten percent of the earliest observations in our historical window are

mapped onto the ﬁrst column of our template; the next 10 percent observations are mapped onto the second column; while the last 10 percent are
mapped onto the tenth column of the template. The highest exchange rate
that occurred during the historical window corresponds to the top of the
template, while the lowest one corresponds to the bottom of the template
so that the vertical dimension of the template grid corresponds to the set of
10 exchange rate subranges. For each trading day we thus have a different
sample of exchange rates in the historical window and consequently the different values of maximum and minimum historical exchange rates corresponding to the top and the bottom of the template; but the number of days
corresponding to each column of the template remains the same, as well as
the length of the historical window itself.
As explained in the pages that follow, the ﬁtting statistic is a weighted
sum of the observations that ﬁt into speciﬁc exchange rate ranges within the
trading window. Each cell in the template represents a weight for a combination of time period and an exchange rate range. An ideally ﬁtting observation would fall into the gray cells with weight 1, while the observations
that do not ﬁt so well would receive smaller weights. Since the seminal work
of Duda and Hart (1973), no particular rule has been devised for the
weights, except for the requirement that the more remote the cells are from
the ones representing the desired pattern (the gray cells), the smaller the
weights should be relative to 1 (the gray cell weight), possibly becoming
negative. This requirement is satisﬁed in all the template patterns we use.
We compute the total ﬁtting value for the historical window as a sum of
the individual f its for the subperiods represented by our template’s
columns. The individual ﬁt for the subperiod is computed by performing
three steps.

133

134

Pa rt I i TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

1. Compute the percentage of observations that falls into each one of
the 10 subranges covered by the historical window.
2. Multiply these percentages by weights in the corresponding cells.
3. Sum the resulting 10 products to get the value of the ﬁt for the
particular subperiod.
For example, if today we choose the historical trading window to be 100
days and the exchange rate ﬂuctuation range between 1 and 2 during the
past 100 days, each column in our template would correspond to a subperiod of 10 days with the ﬁrst row of the template corresponding to the
range of [1.9;2], the second one to [1.8;1.9] and the tenth row (which is
the bottom row) corresponding to the range of [1;1.1]. If, for example, for
the past 100 days the exchange rate were ﬂuctuating in the range of [1.9;2],
then for each 10-day subperiod 100 percent of the observations would
map into the upper row cell so that the value of the ﬁt for each subperiod
would be simply equal to the template weight value, and the total ﬁt for the
historical window would be equal to the sum of the weights in the ﬁrst row
of the template.
In this study we apply the trading window of 40 days, which is the
length used by the authors of studies that apply similar pattern recognition
techniques (Leigh et al., 2002, and references therein). Regarding the
ﬁtting statistic, for each currency pair and the technical analysis pattern, we
round the highest estimated ﬁtting value down to the nearest integer.
Suppose we examine the performance of the bull trading rule in the case of
a EUR/USD currency pair. We determine the entry points by applying the
pattern recognition techniques to the technical analysis patterns as described
above. We then proceed by setting the stop-limit and stop-loss values. Let b be
the stop-limit value, while a is the stop-loss value. We proceed with the
estimation of empirical probabilities of proﬁtable entries as follows.
1. Given the sample of the observed exchange rates for EUR/USD
( January 1, 1999 to January 31, 2007), identify points of entry based
on the bull pattern template from Figure 9.1 and the ﬁtting statistic
level (say, 7).
2. Compute the number of proﬁtable entries, i.e., the ones that result in
the exchange rate deviating by points in the proﬁt-making direction
before deviating by a points in the loss-making direction. Call the

c h a p t e r 9 TE C H N IC A L T R A DING R U LES a n d w i n n i n g

share of such proﬁtable entries Np. This will be our empirical
probability of a proﬁtable entry.
3. As follows from the weak-form EMH, the foreign exchange
movements are described by a simple random walk process, so that
a
the share of proﬁtable entries should approach NEMH  —–— . The
ab
latter follows from the fact that a simple random walk is a martingale
process (Williams, 1991). By computing Np  s and NEHM  s for a
large number of combinations of a and b, we can test whether the
former is statistically greater than the latter.
a
4. In case we ﬁnd Np  NEHM  —–— for a particular trading rule and

currency pair, the average expected empirical return on this rule is
statistically positive for this currency pair, since E[Rp]  S  [Np  b

return on a particular trading rule and a combination of stop-limit
and stop-loss values.
We let a and b vary between 1 and 1,000 points with the increment of
1 point, which supplys us with one million strategies for each currency pair
and the technical analysis pattern (bull ﬂag or double-bottom). The next
section presents and discusses our empirical results.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS
In what follows, we use the following codenames for the currencies in our
sample: EUR is euro, USD is the U.S. dollar, GBP is the British pound,
NZD is the New Zealand dollar, CAD is the Canadian dollar, AUD is the
Australian dollar, CHF is the Swiss franc, and JPY is the Japanese yen. When
a technical analysis rule signals entry into the market, a currency pair is being
bought. For example, if a trader analyses the performance of euros versus U.S.
dollars and deems euro is going to appreciate, she or he buys the EURUSD
currency pair in the sense that the trader is buying euros for U.S. dollars.
Below we present the differences between the empirical probabilities of realizing positive returns by using technical analysis signals and the theoretical
ones. We interpret positive differences as evidence of the technical analysis
rules being able to increase the probability of realizing a positive return.

135

136

Pa rt I i TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

Since both a and b vary within the limits of 1 to 1,000, we have one
million strategies for each currency pair and one of the two technical trading patterns. We tested the extent to which the set of empirical probabilities
of winning Np exceed their theoretical counterparts NEHM in the statistical
sense by employing a two-sample, one-tailed heteroscedastic t test. In all
20 cases, the estimated differences between empirical and theoretical probabilities proved to be statistically signiﬁcant from zero, meaning the two
technical rules we have been using are indeed causing a change in the probability to win or to lose.
As evidenced by Table 9.1, in all but four cases, entering the market
according to one of the two technical trading rules does increase the probability of winning. As mentioned in the Empirical Methodology section, this
is tantamount to realizing a positive return on a technical trading strategy.
It is important to notice, however, that ﬁgures in Table 9.1 are not proﬁts
per se, they are namely differences between empirical and theoretical probabilities of winning.
An interesting question is whether the results reported in Table 9.1 can
be of value to a practicing trader. In fact, the apparent ability of the two
technical trading rules to increase the probability of beating the market
does not necessarily mean that one can identify a strategy that would uniformly result in statistically positive returns.
In order to see whether one can identify such a strategy, we partition the
range of stop-limit values b and stop-loss values a into 10 subranges each, and
see whether we can ﬁnd a particular range of these values that uniformly
results in a higher probability of winning relative to its theoretical counterpart. Table 9.2 below represents such a partition for the case of EURUSD and
the bull charting pattern. Sets of strategies resulting in positive differences

between empirical and theoretical probabilities are shaded. Recall that, as
evidenced by Table 9.1, the average difference between the empirical and theoretical probabilities of winning is statistically negative for this case (i.e., for
the bull pattern in the case of the EURUSD currency pair).
We observe that in not an insigniﬁcant number of cases it is possible
to realize a positive return by following a technical analysis strategy, for
example, by buying euros with U.S. dollars on the bull charting signal in
Figure 9.1, and setting the stop-limit and stop-loss values to be 400 and
600 points, respectively. However, after having inspected similar tables for
all rules and currency pairs, we failed to discover any empirical regularity
in the placement of positive numbered cells in those tables. In other words,
we were unable to ﬁnd a particular range or set of ranges of the stop-limit
and stop-loss values that would result in a statistically positive increase in
the probability of winning for all currencies and both charting patterns.
Table 9.3 presents the cross-currency pair analysis of our strategies’ performance for the bull trading pattern. We look at the 10 subranges of both
stop-limit and stop-loss values and compute the average share of the number
of cases across the 10 currency pairs when the difference between empirical
and theoretical probabilities of winning is positive.
In 86 percent of the cells in Table 9.3 the values are above 50 percent,
implying that the average return across currencies of the double-bottom

trading rule for the corresponding range of stop-limit and stop-loss values
is predominantly statistically positive. We computed a similar table for the
bull ﬂag trading rule and observed the same predominance of the moneymaking strategies over the loss-making ones (90 percent of the cells).
Finally, the regression analysis (results available immediately upon
request) for the individual currency pairs did not reveal any robust relationship between winning probability increases and stop-limit and stop-loss values for neither trading rule and the currency pairs either, leading us to
believe that it is indeed hard to ﬁnd a universally working strategy even if
the technical rules appear to be working on average across currency pairs
and the stop-limit and stop-loss parameters.

CONCLUSION
In this study we examined the abilit y of two technical analysis rules,
namely, the bull and double-bottom pattern, to increase the probability of
winning in the foreign exchange market relative to the theoretical probability. The latter was computed on the basis of the efﬁcient market hypothesis,
implying, among other things, that foreign exchange rates follow a simple
random walk.
In the course of our analysis we tested one million strategies for the
world’s 10 major currency pairs on the dataset covering eight years, which
allows us to formulate two stylized facts that simultaneously demonstrate
the technical analysis’ potential for proﬁtability, and the difﬁculty of its
practical application:
1. The bull and double-bottom technical analysis rules increase on
average the probability of winning compared to what is stipulated by
the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
2. It is hardly possible to indicate a strategy in terms of the trading rule
and a combination of stop-loss and stop-limit values, which would
consistently result in statistically positive proﬁts in the case of all
currency pairs.
The two stylized facts above help explain the persistent popularity of
technical analysis rules among popular traders on the one hand and lack of
the “sure-ﬁre” trading strategies on the other hand (otherwise, everyone
would be a millionaire!). Indeed, while technical analysis appears to be

139

140

increasing the probability of winning, the lack of systemic pattern in the
winning strategies’ parameters and underlying technical trading rules makes
it difﬁcult, if not impossible, to use technical analysis for reaping consistent
positive returns.

Technical Analysis

Financial Markets
Does Nonlinearity Assist?

ABSTRACT
Along with the existence of ﬁnancial markets, ﬁnancial practitioners and
academic researchers are always concerned by the question of whether we
can forecast the future path of stock returns. In theory, if ﬁnancial markets
are not fully efﬁcient under the weak-form as deﬁned by Fama (1970),
investors can generate abnormal proﬁts by performing technical analysis
based on past price and trading volume data. A comparison of the predictive power between competitive models shows that technical trading tools
commonly used might not be valid and effective in turbulent times such as
extreme events and ﬁnancial crisis due explicitly to the assumption of linear
dependences in stock returns. At the empirical level, we ﬁrst apply commonly used chartist tools to empirically study and forecast stock returns
from actual data. These models are then extended to nonlinear framework
and employed to test for the contribution of nonlinearity in modeling stock
returns. Using intraday data from two developed markets (France and
Germany), we point out the superiority of nonlinear models and the contribution of nonlinearity-enhanced technical models over the linear tools,
especially when stock returns are subject to structural changes.

INTRODUCTION
As long as ﬁnancial markets exist, investors and portfolio managers attempt
to make forecasts about the future asset prices based on the latter’s past
patterns. The hope is then to establish trading rules that render their
investments proﬁtable. For many peoples, the question in ﬁnancial practice
is not whether it is possible to forecast the future path of asset prices, but
how to efﬁciently forecast it. Of the techniques used to recommend “buy”
or “sell” signals based on an investigation of the predictability of price
changes, the technical analysis has received less academic attention albeit it
is widely employed by practitioners.1
In theory, the use of technical analysis will have no value if ﬁnancial
markets are at least weak-form efﬁcient since in this case future price
movements cannot be predicted using past price movements (Fama, 1970,
1991). Empirical research is, however, not conclusive on the usefulness of
such trading rules. On the one hand, a number of studies ﬁnd that technical
analysis is unable to reliably predict future returns (Fama and Blume, 1966;
Jensen and Bennington, 1970; Marshall and Cahan, 2005; Marshall, Cahan,
and Cahan, 2008). For example, the study of Marshall et al. (2008) shows
no evidence that technical trading rules are proﬁtable using 5-minute raw
and squared return series in the U.S. equity markets after the bootstrap
methodology is employed to correct for the potential of data snooping
bias.2 Using the similar approach, Marshall and Cahan (2005) reject the
validity of technical analysis for the stock market in New Zealand even
though the latter displays symptoms of an inefﬁcient market such as small
nature, short-selling constraints, and lack of insider trading regulation.
Other studies also report that technical analysis is not proﬁtable once transaction costs are considered (e.g., Allen and Karjalainen, 1999; Olson, 2004).
There is, on the other hand, a considerable amount of evidence to suggest that stock returns display short-term momentum proﬁts and as a result
the use of technical trading rules may lead to economically signiﬁcant
excess returns in ﬁnancial markets (e.g., Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron,
1992; Corrado and Lee, 1992; Bessembinder and Chan, 1995; Hudson,
Dempsey, and Keasey, 1996; Detry and Gregoire, 2001; Lee et al., 2003).
More precisely, Brock et al. (1992) provide evidence that a relatively simple
set of technical trading rules has predictive power for changes in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, while empirical results of subsequent studies are
consistent with proﬁtable technical analysis in European and Asian equity

c h a p t e r 1 0 TE C H N IC A L A N A LY SIS IN T UR B U LEN T M a r k e t s

markets. Overall, past price movements and price trends may still have the
merits in forecasting the future price changes, and technical trading rules
such as moving averages, standard ﬁlter rules, and trading range break have
become standard technical indicators in ﬁnancial practice.
This chapter joins the previous studies by reinvestigating the effectiveness of technical trading rules in two major developed markets, Germany
and France, using intraday data. We contribute to the related literature in
that we introduce nonlinearities into traditional linear technical models to
capture any nonlinear dependence and adjustment in the past price changes.
At the same time, our approach permits to examine the usefulness of technical analysis in ﬁnancial market turbulences, which has rarely been the
focus of previous work. Our motivations come essentially from the fact that
the presence of numerous market distortions during crisis times may lead to
nonlinear forms of price dependence. The obtained results from estimating
nonlinearity-enhanced models conﬁrm effectively our basic intuition that
nonlinearities do improve the effectiveness of technical analysis, especially
during episodes of widespread market panics.
The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows: the second section
of this chapter outlines the reasons for which nonlinearities are introduced
into technical trading rules to test for the effectiveness of technical analysis
against market efﬁciency. This chapter’s third section describes data used
and discusses empirical results. Summary conclusions are provided in this
chapter’s ﬁnal section.

NONLINEAR MODELING FOR
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
The succession of ﬁnancial crises over the past two decades such as the
stock crash in 1987, the Asian ﬁnancial crisis in 1997, the Internet bubble
collapse in 2000, and more recently the current global ﬁnancial crisis in
2007 to 2009 has generated widespread market panics and pointed out the
weakness of the usual ﬁnancial analysis and modeling techniques in forecasting the dynamic of ﬁnancial markets. For example, technical analysis
seems to be relevant only in the short term and may not yield good predictions when markets pass through ﬁnancial turbulences and crises. After
brieﬂy discussing the economic justiﬁcations of nonlinearity for ﬁnancial
markets, we discuss the appropriate nonlinear models to further test the
effectiveness of technical trading rules in turbulent ﬁnancial markets.

Nonlinearity and Stock Market Dynamics
The ﬁnancial literature has advanced several microeconomic and macroeconomic justiﬁcations for the introduction of nonlinearity in modeling
ﬁnancial market dynamics. Regarding microeconomic explanations, one
should note transaction costs (Dumas, 1992; Anderson, 1997), information
asymmetr y (A rt us, 1995), behavioral heterogeneit y (De Grauwe and
Grimaldi, 2005; Boswijk, Hommes, and Manzan, 2007), and mimetic
behavior (Orléan, 1990) that are suggested to be the main sources of
nonlinearity, structural breaks, and changes in asset price dynamics. From
a macroeconomic view, Artus (1995) show that the naissance and withdraw
of speculative bubbles may induce asymmetric and nonlinear dynamics in
ﬁnancial price dynamics.
Empirically, Gouriéroux, Scaillet, and Szafarz (1997) suggest that beside
the fact that ﬁnancial markets are naturally and theoretically characterized
by nonlinear dynamics, the tools used to model stock price dynamics should
capture nonlinearity. The authors identify ﬁve types of nonlinearity. First,
nonlinearity may take root in predicted variables. For example, to evaluate
the risk of a ﬁnancial asset, we forecast its squared return which is a nonlinear variable. Second, nonlinearity is directly incorporated into forecasting
tools used to predict future dynamics of price. Third, nonlinearity is present in the model parameters and is apprehended through the rejection of
the normality for almost all ﬁnancial series. Fourth, nonlinearity characterizing the price dynamics may be due to the presence of nonlinear relationships between past and present realizations of ﬁnancial series (e.g., series of
stock returns). This type of nonlinearity can be present either in the mean
or in the variance of the series under consideration or both. Finally, the last
type of nonlinearity is inherent to ﬁnancial strategies adopted by investors
in order to optimize the risk-return tradeoff.

Nonlinear Models
Several nonlinear models have been used in recent years to reproduce the
dynamics of ﬁnancial markets. Indeed, ﬁnancial return dynamics are often
modeled by using the so-called regime-switching models while generalized
autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity class models are rather applied
to conditionally evaluate return volatility. Among these nonlinear models,
we focus on nonlinear models in mean and particularly on bilinear (BL) and
nonlinear moving average (NMA) models that will be applied to intraday

c h a p t e r 1 0 TE C H N IC A L A N A LY SIS IN T UR B U LEN T M a r k e t s

stock data at the empirical stage. Compared to previous studies on nonlinear stock price dynamics, our empirical investigation has two advantages.
On the one hand, the use of these nonlinear models enables to appropriately extend the usual models of technical analysis (e.g., moving average
model and smoothing model) to a nonlinear context. On the other hand,
their applications to intraday data would enhance the predictive power of
the models used since this analysis appears to be particularly accurate in the
short term.

Bilinear Models (BL)
The BL models were introduced by Granger and Anderson (1978). Their
modeling techniques and different speciﬁcations such as stochastic BL and
determinist BL are rigorously presented in Guégan (1994). BL models constitute an extension for autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models by
adding both compounded AR and MA terms to a traditional ARMA model.
The nonlinearity of BL models is then introduced through these compounded terms. It is worth noting that BL models are generally recommended for reproducing the dynamics of ﬁnancial series with periods of high
volatility followed by phases of lower volatility. Such dynamics characterize
ﬁnancial markets particularly when they pass through turbulent phases.
Let Y t be described by a BL process of (p, q, P, Q) orders, then its
dynamics can be deﬁned as follows:
p

q

P

Q

i =1

j =1

k=1

l =1

Y t = ∑ α i Y t − i + ∑ β j ε t − j + ∑ ∑ δ k l Y t − kε t − l + ε t

(10.1)

where εt is an error term, and αi, βj, and δ kl belong to ᑬ3. If P  Q, the BL
model is said to be upper-diagonal, under-diagonal for P  Q, and diagonal
for P  Q. Assuming that εt → N(0, σε2) and Yt is inversible, i.e., we can
write εt  f (Yt, Yt  1, …), BL models can be estimated using a procedure
similar to that of Box and Jenkins (1970).3 It means that modeling steps that
we usually employ for dealing with ARMA models (i.e., speciﬁcation and
determination of lag number, estimation, validation, and prediction) are also
applicable to BL models. However, it is commonly advised to test the null
hypothesis of linearity against its alternative of nonlinearity in order to
correctly specify the BL models. The Saikkonen and Luukkonen (1991)
test, which contains three main steps below, can be used to test for the
robustness of BL models.

distributed as a χ 2 with (P  Q) degrees of freedom.
BL models were used only in some studies such as Subba Rao and Gabr
(1984), Chan and Tong (1986).4

Nonlinear Moving Average (NMA) Models
NMA models were introduced by Robinson (1977). These models are
based on Volterra developments and are deﬁned as5

(10.2)

where εt is a white noise and θ0 is equal to 1. NMA models are estimated by
the method of moments, but their practical application in economics and
ﬁnance is somewhat limited. In practice, Robinson (1977) has recommended a NLM model of order one as in Equation 10.3 to capture the
asymmetry characterizing business cycles with gradual expansion and
abrupt recession. The NLM model is accordingly suitable for modeling the
dynamics of ﬁnancial markets whose evolution also displays high degree of
asymmetric patterns.
Yt = ε t + θ1ε t −1 + θ 2ε t −1ε t −2

(10.3)

The asymmetry is captured through the term, εt1 εt2, while the forecasting of positive and negative phases is reproduced depending on the

c h a p t e r 1 0 TE C H N IC A L A N A LY SIS IN T UR B U LEN T M a r k e t s

sign of εt and through the observations {εt, εt 1 εt  2, . . .} and {εt,  εt1
 εt2, . . .}, respectively.

DATA AND EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Data and Preliminary Results
Previous studies that focus on technical trading rules show that the analysis
is particularly appropriate in the short term using high frequency data. For
comparative purpose, we employ, in our empirical application, intraday
stock price data of t wo developed countries: France (CAC 40) and
Germany (DAX 30). The use of intraday data permits to test the instantaneous adjustment dynamics of stock markets. Our data, consisting of
ﬁve-minute prices obtained from Euronext database, cover the period from
January 2, 2007 to April 22, 2009 in order to test the effectiveness of technical analysis during the ﬁnancial crisis.
To start, we check the stationarity of our variables using Dickey-Fuller,
Philips-Perron, and KPSS unit root tests. The hypothesis of unit root is
rejected only for the series in the ﬁrst difference, indicating that both
indexes are integrated of order one, I(1).6 We then focus on stock returns
deﬁned as the ﬁrst difference of stock prices expressed in logarithm.
The investigation of descriptive statistics of French and German stock
market intraday returns, reported in Table 10.1, provides evidence of strong
rejection of the symmetry and normality hypotheses. It also shows some
volatility excess and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effects in
French and German stock returns. These ﬁndings indicate a priori some
evidence of nonlinearity and asymmetry characterizing stock price dynamics.
To check the validity of technical analysis, we will ﬁrst estimate usual
linear models, and then we examine whether the introduction of nonlinearity
contributes to improve the forecasting power of technical analysis.

The Linear Modeling
We tested several linear speciﬁcations and ﬁnally retained the two following linear models that provide the best ﬁt to the data: AR(2) and MA(2) for
both market indexes. We report estimation results in Table 10.2. Our ﬁndings indicate some linear temporal dependencies in both index dynamics,
which is typically coherent with the chartist principle. It appears, however,
from squared coefﬁcient as well as information criteria and statistical properties of the estimated residuals that linear models fail to capture the
whole of stock price dynamics, perhaps because of structural breaks caused
by the 2007 to 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. The low level of R2 conﬁrms effectively this result. The latter also induces some asymmetry in price dynamics, which usually calls for the application of a nonlinear rather than linear
framework.

the French market index at the statistical level of 5 percent, while it is
rejected for German market index only at the 10 percent level.
For both indexes, the speciﬁcation tests lead to choose a BL(2,2,2,2) and
NMA of one order that we estimate by the maximum likelihood method.
According to our ﬁndings, BL models seem not to capture the whole nonlinearity characterizing our data (NRNL test), even though nonlinear terms
are statistically signiﬁcant. NMA models seem however to be more appropriate to capture the asymmetry inherent to French and German stock
market dynamics. Indeed, their estimators are statistically signiﬁcant and
they seem to have apprehended all nonlinearity inherent to stock returns
under consideration. In addition, the negativity of their coefﬁcients indicates that French and German indexes are still undervalued and that markets are in phase of correction.
Otherwise, the validation of a NMA model to reproduce these stock
return dynamics indicates a nonlinear time-varying dependency in stock
returns. This is consistent with proﬁtable technical analysis, but suggests an
extension of the usual tools to a nonlinear framework to improve the forecasting accuracy.

CONCLUSION
In this chapter, we have examined the effectiveness of technical trading
rules in two major developed markets, the German and French stock markets, using intraday data. We have used both linear and nonlinear technical
analysis models. The usefulness of nonlinear models is justiﬁed by many
factors, in particular, the presence of numerous market distortions such as
information and transaction costs, asymmetries, investor’s heterogeneity,
and structural changes during ﬁnancial crisis. Our empirical ﬁndings conﬁrm effectively our basic intuition that nonlinearities do improve the effectiveness of technical analysis, especially during episodes of widespread
market panics.

Marshall, Cahan, and Cahan (2008) note that market participants and
journalists consistently attach, according to the results obtained from
surveys, more emphasis on technical analysis than on fundamental
analysis as far as the short-term forecast horizon is concerned. In particular, the respondents give approximately twice as much weight on
technical analysis for intraday horizons as they do for one-year horizons.

The bootstrap methodology was introduced to ﬁnance literature by
Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron (1992) and has become popular for
assessing the statistical signiﬁcance of technical trading rule proﬁtability. It consists of comparing conditional buy or sell signal using the
original return series with conditional buy or sell signal generated from
the corresponding simulated series using speciﬁed technical analysis
models such as moving average, random walk, AR(1), GARCH-M, and
EGARCH. Note that, to obtain the bootstrap results, the initial sample
is simulated n times (n sufﬁciently large, i.e., n is usually higher than
1,000) by resampling with replacement so that the usual normal distribution needs not to be assumed for the model residuals.

Proﬁting from the
Dual-Moving
Average Crossover
with Exponential
Smoothing
Camillo Lento

ABSTRACT
This chapter reexamines the profitabilit y of the dual-moving average
crossover trading rule by analyzing the incremental proﬁt contribution of
utilizing an exponential smoothing technique to calculate the moving averages. The analysis is conducted on the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones
Industrial Average from January 1999 to April 2009 (N  2,596). The
results suggest that the proﬁtability of the moving average cross-over rule is
signiﬁcantly enhanced by using an exponential smoothing technique that
reduces the weight of the most recent price observation. The additional
proﬁts are not the result of increased risk. Rather, exponentially smoothing
prices to calculate the moving averages results in a fewer number of signals
that are more informative. Bootstrapping simulations were used to test for
signiﬁcance.

INTRODUCTION
The dual-moving average crossover (DMACO) trading strategy is one of
the simplest, yet most popular trading rules among practitioners (Taylor
and Allen, 1992; Lui and Mole, 1998). It is one of the few trading rules that
is statistically well deﬁned (Neftci, 1991). The DMACO is calculated with
two moving averages of a security price. Relative to each other, one moving
average is short term (STMA), while the other long term (LTMA). The
LTMA will move in the same direction as the STMA, but will have a lower
variance and move at a slower rate. The different rate of direction creates
situations where the values of the two moving averages may equal or
crossover one another. These crossover points generate buy and sell signals
under the DMACO. A buy signals occurs when the STMA rises above the
LTMA, whereas a sell signal occurs when the STMA breaks below the
LTMA (Murphy, 2000).
Various studies have tested the proﬁtability of technical trading rules
(e.g., Bessembinder and Chan, 1998; Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang, 2000;
Lento, 2008). This chapter provides new insights on the proﬁtability and
sign prediction ability of the DMACO by utilizing an exponential smoothing technique to calculate the STMA and LTMA. Traditionally, the latest
prices are of the most value to an exponentially smoothed average. However, this study utilizes a smoothing technique that places more weight on
the older values.
The trading rules are tested on the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) for the period January 1999 to April 2009
(N  2,596). The results suggest that the proﬁtability of DMACO is signiﬁcantly enhanced when the STMA and LTMA are calculated with the
exponential smoothing technique. The increased proﬁtability is signiﬁcant, in many cases in excess of 5.0 percent per annum, and consistent
across each moving average combination and index. Proﬁtability is deﬁned
as returns in excess of the naïve buy-and-hold trading strategy.
The additional proﬁts are not the result of increased risk. Rather, exponentially smoothing prices to calculate the moving averages results in a
fewer number of signals that are more informative. The results from the
sign prediction tests are consistent with the proﬁtability tests as large, positive returns followed the buy signal of the exponentially smoothed DMACO
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: the next section
describes the DMACO. The third section of this chapter describes the

c h a p t e r 1 1 P r o f i t i n g f r o m t h e D u a l - M o v i n g Av e r a g e

data, while the fourth section explains the methodology. This chapter’s
ﬁfth section presents the results, and a conclusion is provided in the ﬁnal
section.

BACKGROUND ON THE MOVING AVERAGES
The Dual-Moving Average Crossover Trading Rule
The DMACO produces a buy (sell) signal when the STMA cuts the LTMA
from below (above). The simple rule has a large variety of forms based on
the timeframe selected for each average (Neely, Weller, and Dittmar, 1997).
The intuition behind the DMACO can be explained in terms of momentum. When SMTA is greater than the LTMA, the security’s value in the
recent past exceeds its value in the more distant past, which in moving average models signals that an upward trend is developing (Levich, 2001).
When the STMA moves below the LTMA, this provides a lagged indicator
that the price is moving downward relative to the historical price.
There are two variants of the DMACO trading rule: variable length
moving average (VMA), and the ﬁxed-length moving average (FMA). The
VMA generates a buy (sell) signal whenever the STMA is above (below) the
LTMA. After a buy (sell) signal, the investor will be long (out of ) the market until a sell (buy) signal is generated. Conversely, the FMA focuses solely
on the crossing of the moving averages. This method stresses that the
returns should be different for a few days following a crossover (Brock,
Lakonishok, and LeBaron, 1992).

Empirical Tests of DMACO Trading Rule1
There are many studies on moving average rules. Brock et al. (1992) was
one of the most inﬂuential, and found that returns generated from the
signals of a DMACO rule outperformed three popular models (AR(1),
GARCH-M, and the exponential GARCH). Buy signals resulted in
higher returns than sell signals, and displayed less volatility than the sell
signal returns.
Levich and Thomas (1993) also tested moving average rules to evaluate
the potential for abnormal proﬁts. Their study suggests that the DMACO
generated excess returns that would have been highly unlikely to have been
observed by chance.

Gençay and Stengos (1998) tested a 50-day and a 200-day DMACO.
Linear and nonlinear models were used to assess the predictability the signals on the daily DJIA from 1897 to 1988. The results provide evidence of
a 10 percent (or better) forecasting improvement during the Great
Depression years and in the years 1980 to1988. The technical trading
rules provided more moderate returns during the period 1939 to 1950.
Gençay (1999) corroborated the signiﬁcance of moving average rules as a
tool to predict foreign exchange rates. He concluded that simple moving
average rules provide signiﬁcant correct signals and returns.
However, the literature does not provide consensus support for the profitability of the DMACO. For example, Kho (1996) presents a contrary
viewpoint by supporting the ineffectiveness of technical trading rules by
suggesting that time-varying risk premiums can explain a substantial
amount of the proﬁtability of DMACO in foreign currency markets.
Recent research reveals that DMACO is proﬁtable in certain Asian
equity markets (Lento, 2007). The DMACO trading rule was proﬁtable in
22 of the 24 (91.7 percent) tests. The 1-day, 50-day DMACO performed
the best as all nine variants tested outperformed the buy-and-hold trading
strategy as it earned annual excess returns in the range of 1.8 percent to
32.6 percent. The 1-day, 200-day DMACO also earned annual excess
returns in the range of 1.5 percent to 10.9 percent.

Exponential Smoothing and Moving Averages
A moving average relies equally on past observations (i.e., the weight
assigned to the observations are the same and equal to 1/N). Exponential
smoothing assigns exponentially decreasing weights to older observations.
In other words, recent observations are given relatively more weight in forecasting than older observations. There is one or more smoothing parameter
to be determined (or estimated) in exponential smoothing and these
choices determine the weights assigned to the observations (Hyndman
et al., 2008).
Exponential smoothing has been used in technical trading rules. For
example, the triple exponential smoothing oscillator (TRIX) was developed
by John Hutson, while Gerald Appel developed the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD). Although exponential smoothing is used in
practice to develop trading rules, little academic research exists that tests
the proﬁtability of exponential smoothing techniques. Speciﬁcally, there is

c h a p t e r 1 1 P r o f i t i n g f r o m t h e D u a l - M o v i n g Av e r a g e

no known research that tests whether exponential smoothing can increase
the proﬁtability and sign prediction ability of the DMACO. This chapter
helps to ﬁll this gap in the literature.

METHODOLOGY
Calculating the Dual-Moving Average Crossover Trading
Signals
As discussed, the DMACO generates a buy (sell) signal whenever the
STMA is above (below) the LTMA as follows:

∑

(11.2)

where Ri,t is the average security price given the number of days that deﬁnes
the STMA, and is R i,t1 the average price over the number of days the
deﬁnes the LTMA.
Traditionally, the STMA and LTMA are calculated with the security
price time-series. The moving averages in this study are calculated with an
exponentially smoothed security price-time series. The smoothing scheme
employs the single exponential smoothing methodology and begins by deﬁning S2 to y1, where Si stands for smoothed observation, and y stands for the
original security price. The subscripts refer to the time periods, 1, 2, …, n.
For the third period, S3  y2  (1 – ) S2. The smoothed series starts with
the smoothed version of the second observation (i.e., there is no S1). For any
time period t, the smoothed value St is found by computing:
St = α yt −1 + (1 − α )St −1

o <α ≤1

t ≥3

(11.3)

where parameter  is the smoothing constant. Normally, α is set to greater
than 50 percent to allow for more weight on the more recent observation.
However, this study utilizes an α of 10 percent, thereby placing signiﬁcantly

159

160

Pa rt I i TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

less weight on the recent observation. More weight is placed on the past
observations to eliminate any excess volatility or noise created by a single
observation. The STMA and LTMA will be calculated on the exponentially
smoothed time-series (exponentially smoothed DMACO), as opposed to the
raw prices (traditional DMACO). The following STMA,LTMA combinations will be used: (1,50), (10,50), and (1,200).

Calculating the Proﬁts
Proﬁtabilit y is determined by comparing the returns generated by the
DMACO to the buy-and-hold return. The buy-and-hold returns are calculated by investing at t1 and holding the security until the end of the data set.
This test does not rely on short sales. Rather, after a sell signal, the returns
are calculated by assuming that the capital will be placed in savings account.
An average, nominal interest rate of 3 percent per annum will be earned
while out of the market.
The methodology relies on this simple technique because of the possible problems related to nonlinear models such as computational expensiveness, over-ﬁtting, data snooping, and difﬁculties interpreting the results
(see White, 2005 for a thorough discussion of these issues).
The proﬁt generated from the DMACO are adjusted for both the bidask spread and brokerage costs (similar to Gençay, 1998). The bid-ask
spread for the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and DJIA exchange traded funds are
used as a proxies for the actual index.

Bootstrapping to Estimate Statistical Signiﬁcance
The signiﬁcance of the results is tested by using the bootstrap approach
developed by Levich and Thomas (1993). This approach, ﬁrst, observes
the data set of closing prices, with the sample size denoted by N  1, that
corresponds to a set of N returns. The mth (m  1, …, M) permutation of
these N returns (M  N! ) is related to a unique proﬁt measure (X [m, r])
for the rth trading rule variant (r  1, …, R) used in this study. Thus, for
each variable, a new series can be generated by randomly reshufﬂing the
returns of the original series.
To maintain the distributional properties of the original data, the starting
and ending points of the randomly generated time-series are ﬁxed at their
original values for each sequence of M returns. However, the time-series

c h a p t e r 1 1 P r o f i t i n g f r o m t h e D u a l - M o v i n g Av e r a g e

properties are random. Various notional paths that the returns could have
taken from time t (starting day) to time t  n (ending day) can be generated.
An empirical distribution of proﬁts X [m, r] is generated by applying the
DMACO to the notional paths. A simulated p value is produced by computing the proportion of returns generated from the simulated series that is
greater than the return computed with the actual series.

Sign Prediction Ability of the DMACO
In addition to proﬁts, the effectiveness of DMACO’s ability to predict
future price movements will be evaluated. A buy (sell) signal is correct if
the holding period return following the signal is positive (negative). A 1-day
and 10-day lag will be utilized to evaluate the signals (Brock et al., 1992).
The predictive value (PV) is calculated as follows:
(CSt) / (CSt  ISt)

(11.4)

where CSt denotes the number of correct buy signals given the time lag t,
and ISt denotes the number of incorrect buy signals given the time lag t.
Analyzing the aggregate daily returns that follow a signal will provide
insight into the sign prediction ability. A large, positive (negative) return
would be expected to follow a buy (sell) signal. The signiﬁcance of the
returns will be determined by testing for a difference between returns following the buy and sell (buy-sell) signals. The trading rules can forecast
future movements of security returns if the difference between the buy-sell
returns is positive and signiﬁcant. The t statistic will be calculated as follows
(Brock et al., 1992):2

µb − µ s
( σ 2b / ηb ) + ( σ 2s / ηs )

(11.5)

DATA
The technical trading rules are tested on daily data from the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and DJIA for the period January 1999 to April 2009 (N  2,596). The
10-year period provides a sufﬁcient number of observations to test the

161

162

Pa rt I i TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

DMACO trading rule. The daily returns are calculated as the holding period
return of each day as follows:
rt  log (pt ) – log (p t1)

(11.6)

where pt denotes the market price.

TRADING WITH THE EXPONENTIALLY
SMOOTHED DMACO
The following section describes the empirical results of the exponentially
smoothed DMACO by assessing the trading rule’s proﬁtability and sign
prediction ability. The results suggest that the exponentially smoothed
DMACO is able to generate signiﬁcant proﬁts by producing fewer, more
powerful, trading signals than the traditional DMACO.

Proﬁts from the Exponentially Smoothed DMACO
The results on the proﬁtability of the exponentially smoothed DMACO are
very impressive. The results are presented in Table 11.1. Both the buy-andhold trading strategy and the traditional DMACO experienced negative
returns, while the exponentially smoothed DMACO was proﬁtable in all
settings. The exponentially smoothed DMACO outperformed the traditional DMACO trading rule in all nine tests. The excess proﬁts were large,
and signiﬁcant, ranging from 3.5 percent to 8.6 percent. The excess returns
over the buy-and-hold trading strategy are even larger.
A possible explanation for the excess proﬁts could be that the exponentially smoothed DMACO takes on additional risks (i.e., the proﬁts are more
volatile). To test this possible explanation, the Sharpe ratio has been calculated for the returns from both DMACO calculations. The Sharpe ratio is
presented in Table 11.1 and reveals that the exponentially smoothed
DMACO does not take on additional risk. Conversely, six of the nine tests
reveal that the returns from the exponentially smoothed DMACO are less
risky than the traditional model.
The DMACO earned the excess proﬁts on less trading signals than the
traditional model. Aside from the obvious fact that the reduced number of
trading signals resulted in less transaction costs, the results appear to suggest that the exponentially smoothed DMACO generates trading signals

further tested and corroborated through section Sign Prediction Ability
testing.

Sensitivity of Proﬁts to the Smoothing Factor
As discussed in the methodology, an exponential smoothing factor (α) of 10
percent was utilized in this study, thereby placing signiﬁcantly less weight
on the more recent observation. It is important to investigate the sensitivity
of the smoothing factor on the proﬁts generated by exponentially smoothed
DMACO model.

Figure 11.1 presents a chart of the excess proﬁts generated on the NASDAQ by the three exponentially smoothed DMACO variants (over the traditional model) with various smoothing factors. Figure 11.1 reveals that the
excess proﬁts from the exponentially smoothed DMACO diminish as the
smoothing factor (α) shifts from 10 percent to 100 percent, or stated differently, as more weight is placed on the most recent daily observation. This
observation is most clearly evident with the DMACO (1,200) and DMACO
(1,50). Interestingly, the DMACO (10,20) generated excess returns for
most of the α, with a steep decline from 80 percent to 100 percent.
Figure 11.1 presents the results from only the NASDAQ. The same test
on the S&P 500 and DJIA reveals similar results (data not presented).

Sign Prediction Ability of the Exponentially Smoothed
DMACO
The PV of each trading signal given a 1-day and 10-day lag is presented in
Table 11.2. Note that Table 11.1 presents the results of the VMA from a
proﬁtability standpoint, while the sign prediction ability tests the FMA
perspective as deﬁned by Brock et al. (1992). The binomial probability distribution was used to calculate the probability of the PV occurring by
chance, and can be interpreted similar to a p value.

Overall, the buy signals were correct more often than the sell signals. At
both the 1-day and 10-day lag, 14 of the 18 tests of the exponentially
smoothed DMACO had PVs of greater than 50 percent, whereas the traditional DMACO resulted in 12 of 18 positive PVs. At the 10-day lag, six
of the nine exponentially smoothed DMACO sell signals had PVs greater
than 50 percent.
The aggregate daily returns that follow the buy and sell signals and the
buy-sell t statistics are presented in Table 11.3. The daily returns following
the signals should provide the same conclusion regarding the informational
content of trading rule signals as the predictive value analysis.

The return analysis is consistent with the proﬁtability and predictive
value tests. At the 1-day lag, the returns following a buy signal were positive in four of nine for the traditional DMACO, while the exponentially
smoothed DMACO buy signals were followed by positive returns in six of
the nine tests. At the 10-day lag, all nine tests of the exponentially
smoothed DMACO’s buy signal generated positive returns. The sell signals
do not appear to be as predictive. At the 1-day lag, negative returns following a sell signal in four of nine for the traditional DMACO, while the exponentially smoothed DMACO’s sell signals were followed by negative
returns in only three of the nine tests. However, at the 10-day lag, the
exponentially smoothed DMACO’s sell signal was followed by negative
returns in seven of the nine tests. These results are similar to prior studies
(Brock et al.,1992; Lento & Gradojevic, 2007).
The results from the sign prediction tests (predictive value and return
analysis) are consistent with the proﬁtability tests, and corroborate the
proposition that the exponentially smoothed DMACO results in fewer,
more powerful signals than the traditional DMACO model.

CONCLUSION
This chapter provides new insights into the proﬁtability of technical analysis by developing and testing a trading model that is shown to earn abnormal profits, and predict f ut ure price movements. The exponentially
smoothed DMACO was tested on the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and DJIA for
the period January 1999 to April 2009. The results suggest that the profitability of DMACO is signiﬁcantly enhanced when the STMA and LTMA
are calculated with the exponential smoothing technique. The increased
proﬁtability is signiﬁcant, in many cases in excess of 5.0 percent per annum,
and consistent across each moving average combination and data set.
The additional proﬁts are not the result of increased risk. Rather, exponentially smoothing prices results in a fewer number of signals that are
more informative. The results from the sign prediction tests are consistent
with the proﬁtability tests as large, positive returns follow the buy signal of
the exponentially smoothed DMACO.
This study also investigated the sensitivity of the proﬁts to the smoothing factor, and reveals that the proﬁts decline as the smoothing factor
increases (i.e., as more weight is placed on the most recent observation).
Researchers are encouraged to further explore the proﬁtabilit y of the

167

168

Pa rt I i TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

DMACO by utilizing different smoothing technique. For example, the
STMA and LTMA can be calculated on a time-series that has been
smoothed with a double or triple exponential smoothing technique as
opposed to the single exponential smoothing technique.
The traditional DMACO trading rules have been shown to be proﬁtable
as inputs into the combined signal approach (Lento, 2008). Investors can
also explore the proﬁtability of the exponentially smoothed DMACO by
jointly employing the individual DMACO trading rules into the combined
signal approach (Lento, 2008; Lento, 2009).

Shareholder
Demands and the
Delaware Derivative
Action
Edward Pekarek

ABSTRACT
Among the most “interesting and ingenious” corporate “accountability
mechanisms” is the shareholder derivative action. An aggrieved investor
may demand the independent directors of a corporate issuer to litigate on
behalf of the corporation, for harm(s) allegedly committed upon the corporation. This chapter explores who is eligible to sue derivatively and identiﬁes some of the basic requirements to initiate derivative litigation.

INTRODUCTION
The efﬁcient market hypothesis (EMH) presumes that existing stock prices
always reﬂect the entire universe of information that is relevant to a given
security. The EMH posits that the so-called “free” market functions as a
pure pricing mechanism and equities will always trade at their relative “fair
value” in a liquid and transparent market, leaving investors facing the
impossible, at least in theory, to outperform the overall market through
expert portfolio strategies, stock selection or market timing.
Various studies, including a number of those analyzed in the preceding
chapters of this section, have revealed the possibility that technical trading
171

172

Pa rt i I TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

rules may produce investment results which are superior to traditional
“buy and hold” portfolio selection strategies. While the application of
technical trading rules may result in an increased probability of investment
success, no amount of portfolio selection modeling, no matter how prescient, can prevent, or predict precisely, the presence of concealed corporate wrongdoing.
While some trading models utilize historical data such as moving averages, and still others seek to extrapolate future results through the use of
nonlinearity-enhanced technical models or pattern recognition techniques,
corporate insiders can, and do, go to great lengths to prevent transgressions
such as self-dealing from being discovered by the market. Of course, one
need only look to the headlines in the ﬁnancial media during the macro
decline of 2008 and 2009 for ample evidence that corporate wrongdoing is
just as prevalent today as it was during the cynical era of Enron, or the
“wild west” environment which made Jesse Livermore infamous.
This necessarily begs the question of how statistical modeling has consistently failed to detect this sort of undisclosed insider activity, and if the
EMH pricing mechanism does properly discount all relevant information at
any given moment, insider misconduct such as that which occurred in the
Enron, Tyco, Worldcom, HealthSouth, or Adelphia scandals, should simply
never have the chance to fester into enterprise-destroying frauds without
being discovered. Nonetheless, sage fund managers, such as James Chanos,
proﬁt from a fraud scheme’s imminent collapse through short-sale strategies. See Chanos (2002).
Some pundits maintain technical analysis and trading acumen can be
confounded by market manipulation. See Degraaf (2009). Still others view
chart interpretation and analysis as something akin to a “methodology for
interpreting . . . the behavior of [humans] and markets” through a record
of “inerasable ﬁngerprints of human nature made graphic in the greatest
struggle, next to war, in human experience” Edwards, Magee, and Bassetti
(2007). The question of whether technical analysis can reveal such manipulation, as well as other forms of wrongdoing involving the managers of
publicly held issuers, the corporate board of directors, is not the topic of
this chapter. See 8 Del. C. § 141. This chapter contemplates some of the
remedies available to shareholders of Delaware corporations where such
wrongdoing has occurred.
Among the more “interesting and ingenious” corporate “accountability
mechanisms” devised by common law to address such wrongdoing, is the

c h a p t e r 1 2 t h e D e l awa r e D e r i vat i v e A c t i o n

shareholder derivative action. Kramer, 546 A.2d at 351; see also Block, Barton, and Radin (1987). Derivative litigation has been instituted by shareholders of Delaware corporations in federal courts throughout the United
States. See In re CNET Networks, Inc., 483 F. Supp. 2d 947; In re BristolMyers Squibb, 2007 WL 959081; Prince, 148 Fed. Appx. 249. The necessary
initial step a shareholder must take in pursuit of derivative relief is to communicate a demand to the corporation’s “independent” directors, in which it
must articulate the speciﬁc relief she or he seeks. If the “independent”
director(s) refuse to take the action(s) demanded by the shareholder, or, if a
lawful basis exists for the shareholder to be excused from the demand
requirement, derivative litigation may proceed, provided certain other
requirements are ﬁrst satisﬁed.
Unlike claims for breach of duty, securities fraud, and the like, where the
plaintiff(s) typically seeks relief related to alleged harms committed upon
them as individuals by corporate ﬁduciaries, and perhaps by others, derivative litigation is reportedly “popular” because stock losses are not required
to bring an action, as is the case with securities fraud litigation (Koppel,
2009). A typical shareholder derivative action involves the pursuit of civil
and/or equitable relief on behalf of a corporation in which an investor owns
an equity stake, often in the form of common stock. Blasband, 971 F.2d at
1040. The derivative shareholder litigates as a nominal plaintiff only, acting
on behalf of the corporation in which she or he owns equity, for harm(s)
allegedly committed upon the corporation, and as the term suggests, one who
sues derivatively, “seeks redress on behalf of the corporation.” Kramer, 546
A.2d at 351; see also Block, Barton, and Radin (1987); Ryan, 918 A.2d at
349. Pre-suit requirements established by Delaware law contain subtle
nuances, some of which can result in the dismissal of a derivative action if
performed improperly or ignored.

POLICY PURPOSES FOR DERIVATIVE ACTIONS
Delaware law developed the derivative action as a mechanism to enforce various rights of the corporation, and indirectly, its stakeholders, through the
assertion of civil (and/or equitable) claims on behalf of that corporation,
which, it has itself refused, Kramer, 546 A.2d at 351; see also Block, Barton,
and Radin (1987), or “failed to enforce [rights] which may properly be
asserted.” Aronson, 473 A.2d at 808 n.1; Maldonado, 413 A.2d at 1255; Harff,
324 A.2d at 218; Cantor, 18 Del. Ch. 359. A shareholder suing derivatively is

173

174

Pa rt i I TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

a nominal litigant, acting on behalf of and for the beneﬁt of the corporation,
which is named, nominally, as a defendant that is concurrently the indispensable, Agostino, 845 A.2d at 1116–17 n.15, “real party in interest to which
any recovery usually belongs.” Schuster, 127 Cal. App. 4th at 312; see also
In re Tyson Foods, Inc., 919 A.2d 563; Maldonado, 413 A.2d at 1255; Levine,
219 A.2d at 145; Slutzker, 28 A.2d at 528; Solimine, 19 A.2d at 344. Corporate policy reforms and relief of other ilk may result from a successful derivative action, but the shareholder(s) recover(s) no money damages. At least
one court has recently treated the shareholder of a corporation as a ﬁduciary
for the purposes of derivative litigation. Egelhof, 2008 WL 352668. Directors and the nominal defendant corporation typically retain separate counsel
due to the inherent tension unique to derivative litigation. Kolbe, 1988
WL 110511, at *1.
A nominal corporate defendant’s state of incorporation is generally the
source of the substantive (and certain procedural) law applied, including the
speciﬁc derivative demand requirements, compare Fed. R. Civ. P. R. 23.1
with Del. Ch. R. 23.1, as well as any related demand(s) for books and
records. See 8 Del. C. § 220. According to New York law, “issues related to
the ‘internal affairs’ of a corporation are decided under the law of the state
of incorporation because that state has an interest superior to that of other
states in regulating the internal affairs of its corporation.” Potter, 11 Misc.
3d at 965–66. Notwithstanding the above, a shareholder’s ﬁrst obstacle is
often navigating the demand requirements of Delaware law, because of its
inﬂuence as the “preeminent . . . place for businesses to incorporate since
the early 1900s,” and accordingly, due to the signiﬁcant number of publicly
held concerns which are Delaware corporations (Black, 2007).

DEMAND REQUIREMENTS
Because derivative litigation “impinges on the managerial freedom of
directors,” a shareholder can only initiate a derivative suit subsequent to
the assertion of a written demand upon the independent directors that
articulated actions be pursued on behalf of the corporation. Stone, 911
A.2d at 366. Both the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Delaware
Chancery Court Rules, with limited exceptions, require that a demand be
made and served upon a corporation’s directors. Compare Del. Ch. Court
R. 23.1 with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1. Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure codified a long-standing common law requirement that a

c h a p t e r 1 2 t h e D e l awa r e D e r i vat i v e A c t i o n

shareholder must ﬁrst make a demand upon directors before initiating
derivative litigation. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1; Mullins, 45 F.Supp. 871;
Findley, 240 P.2d 421. In a so-called “double” derivative suit, in which a
shareholder of a parent corporation alleges injury(ies) to a subsidiary, any
demand(s) must also be made on the subsidiar y directors, unless the
demand is excused by law, for example, by what is known as “futility,” a
factual condition which must ﬁrst be demonstrated as to the directors of
both the subsidiary and the parent. Rales, 634 A.2d at 934.
A shareholder demand should “alert the [b]oard of [d]irectors so that it
can take such corrective action, if any, as it feels is merited.” Allison, 604
F.Supp. at 1117. The derivative demand is also a mechanism designed “to
curb a myriad of individual shareholders from bringing potentially frivolous lawsuits on behalf of the corporation, which may tie up the corporation’s governors in constant litigation and diminish the board’s authority
to govern the affairs of the corporation.” Ryan, 918 A.2d at 352; see also
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1; Del Ch. Court R. 23.1. One district court recently
criticized “scandalous” derivative litigation, and opined that it t ypiﬁed
“[t]he very abuses that led to the reform embodied by the PSLR A permeate the world of derivative litigation.” In re JPMorgan Chase & Co., 2008
WL 4298588, at *10; id.
Delaware and federal rules offer little guidance regarding what must
actually appear within a shareholder demand. Neither rule provides speciﬁc
detail as to other mechanical and procedural aspects of a proper demand.
Rule 23.1 does clearly mandate, however, that a valid shareholder demand
must be made upon directors of the corporation, or upon a “comparable
authority.” If such a demand is not communicated to the corporation’s
directors, the shareholder’s pleadings must articulate in detail the reason(s)
for failure to assert a demand. See Simon, 775 N.Y.S.2d at 317; id. Delaware
courts have detailed technical requirements for shareholder demands. See
Allison, 604 F.Supp. at 1117; id.

All “Reasonably Available” Information Should Be Gathered
for a Demand
A prudent shareholder will expend all reasonable efforts and exhaust all
reasonable means to gather relevant facts prior to bringing derivative litigation, and the due diligence performed prior to crafting a demand should
be no exception. Beam I, 845 A.2d at 1056; id. Potential sources of relevant

175

176

Pa rt i I TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

information for an investigating shareholder include: SEC ﬁlings, local
tax authority records, county property records, state and federal court
dockets, secretaries of state corporation ﬁlings; as well as a variety of nongovernment sources, including media reports, press releases, investor relations representatives, corporate Web sites and business data sources such as
Bloomberg, Dun & Bradstreet, Hoovers, Westlaw, and Lexis; and self-regulatory organizations such as stock exchanges and the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Rales, 634 A.2d at 935 n.10.
Shareholders contemplating derivative litigation are encouraged by courts
to employ Delaware’s Section 220 demand to inspect corporate books and
records as a fact-ﬁnding tool prior to initiating a derivative action. See, e.g.,
id. If a tribunal determines that a failure to employ a Section 220 demand
before initiating derivative litigation was unreasonable, under the circumstances of the case, the risk of dismissal is substantial. Id. If a shareholder
seeks to be excused from the demand requirement, it is virtually expected
that the shareholder will have ﬁrst “used a Section 220 books and records
inspection to uncover such facts,” before seeking relief from the Delaware
Chancery Court. Id.; Beam II, 833 A.2d at 983–84; see In re Walt Disney Co.,
825 A.2d at 279; see also Beam I, 845 A.2d at 1056 n.51.
Many legitimate uses exist for the information that results from corporate books and records inspections, such as “bring[ing] a derivative suit in
the case of corporate waste or mismanagement, or to bring a suit attaching
some aspect of a company’s public disclosures,” or to evaluate the propriety
of the refusal by directors to satisfy the terms of a shareholder demand. See,
e.g., Disney, 2005 WL 1538336, at *5; see also Grimes, 724 A.2d at 564.
A Delaware court recently noted that directors are afforded an opportunity
to “exculpate themselves” in the face of a Section 220 demand. In re Tyson
Foods, Inc., 919 A.2d at 578.
The Section 220 inspection provisions function, inter alia, to: (i) investigate a company’s suspected wrongdoing; (ii) ensure that it can prepare a
thorough shareholder demand; and (iii) form the basis of a particularized
pleading; and (iv) “can serve as a ‘tool at hand’ [for directors] to defend
against unfounded charges of wrongdoing.” Id. at 578 n.20. The unique
opportunity for directors to inform aggrieved shareholders, and to demonstrate the directors exercised good faith business judgment in the disputed
managerial decisions, including responses to shareholder demands, serves as
a valuable by-product of the requirement that a shareholder must conduct a
duly diligent investigation of all reasonably available information prior to

c h a p t e r 1 2 t h e D e l awa r e D e r i vat i v e A c t i o n

asserting a demand. The liberal use of Section 220 inspections before ﬁling
a derivative action supports the ideal of judicial economy pragmatically,
because it may deter some meritless litigation. Id.
At least one Delaware jurist has noted, with apparent disappointment,
“surprisingly, little use has been made of section 220,” he speculated the
books and records demand remains fallow, in the derivative context, due to
“an unseemly race to the court house, chieﬂy generated by the ‘ﬁrst to ﬁle’
custom seemingly permitting the winner of the race to be named lead
counsel.” Rales, 634 A.2d at 935 n.10. Considering the depth of factual
detail often required to assert a shareholder demand properly, and mindful
of the Delaware courts’ criticism of litigants who have not utilized the tools
made available to them, a Section 220 demand to inspect corporate books
and records is likely part of a prudent course of conduct prior to the assertion of a derivative demand upon a corporation’s independent directors.

Demand Deadlines: When Must Directors Respond?
Delaware law affords directors broad discretion to determine whether to
bring a lawsuit on behalf of the corporation they manage in response to a
shareholder demand. 8 Del. C. § 141(a); see also In re IAC/InterActiveCorp.
Sec. Litig., 478 F. Supp. 2d. at 598. Directors of Delaware corporations are
generally protected from liability for refusing a shareholder demand, provided the decision was not “wrongful,” meaning that the refusal was:
(i) a legitimate exercise of the directors’ good faith business judgment; and
(ii) a sound exercise of lawful discretion. Aronson, 473 A.2d at 813; id. The
amount of time directors are permitted to render decisions regarding shareholder demands varies widely, with “no precise rule as to how much time a
[b]oard must be given to respond to a demand.” Allison, 604 F.Supp. at
1117–18. Procedural rules do not specify how long recipient directors have
to respond to a shareholder demand.
Delaware courts consider complexities of contended issues and the
directors’ actions in response to a proper shareholder demand. Where
directors do not respond to a shareholder demand, jurists employ factintensive analysis, guided by a rule of reason, in order to determine
whether the time between the assertion of a shareholder demand, and the
ﬁling of a derivative action, is appropriate or premature. One such court
held a derivative suit initiated one month after asserting a shareholder
demand was appropriate, Rubin, 701 F. Supp. at 1046, while another found

177

178

Pa rt i I TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

the filing of a derivative complaint roughly 10 weeks after serving a
demand was premature, reasoning the “magnitude and complexit y” of
contested issues warranted affording the directors additional time to
decide, see Allison, 604 F.Supp. at 1118, while yet another tribunal found an
eight-month interval to be insufﬁcient, due to the particular complexities
of that case. Mozes, 638 F. Supp. at 221.
Juridical determination of whether the initiation of derivative litigation
is premature is guided by a case-by-case consideration which utilizes
highly fact-intensive f indings to scrutinize whether directors have
informed themselves “of all material information essential to an objective
and meaningf ul evaluation of the demand.” Allison, 604 F.Supp. at
1117–18; Abramowitz, 513 F.Supp. at 132–33. This standard suggests the
degree of detail provided by a shareholder derivative demand might
directly inﬂuence what is perceived to be a reasonable amount of time for
directors to respond. Perhaps an inversely correlative relationship exists
between: (i) the amount of time directors are afforded to render a decision
regarding a shareholder demand; and (ii) the depth of detail within the
factual information provided in such a demand, relative to the factual
complexity of the disputed issue(s).

STANDING TO SUE DERIVATIVELY
A timely, duly diligent, and otherwise proper demand that directors initiate
suit on behalf of the corporation is a condition precedent to the commencement of Delaware derivative litigation. Del. Ch. Court R. 23.1; Fed. R. Civ.
P. 23; see also In re eBay, Inc. Shareholders Litig., 2004 WL 253521, at *2; see
also In re J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., 2005 WL 1076069, at *8. Absent a legal
excuse, it is a “threshold question of standing as to whether the shareholder
has made a demand on the board of directors.” In re IAC/InterActiveCorp
Sec. Litig., 478 F. Supp. 2d at 597. The viability of a derivative suit can turn
on the initial inquiry of whether the shareholder has competently pleaded
standing relative to an allegedly wrongful refusal of a properly asserted
demand, or of the futility of asserting such a demand, which, if established,
would obviate the demand requirement. Miller, 1992 WL 329313, at *5; see
also Futility discussion, infra. A shareholder who contends she or he has
standing to sue derivatively, as a function of legal excuse due to demand
futility, must adhere to alternative pleading requirements set forth in Delaware Chancery Rule 23.1. Id.; see also id. at *5 n.10.

c h a p t e r 1 2 t h e D e l awa r e D e r i vat i v e A c t i o n

Continued Shareholder Status
In order to impose a derivative demand upon a Delaware corporation, a
prospective nominal plaintiff “must have been a shareholder at the time of
the challenged transaction[s] to have standing to maintain a shareholder
derivative suit.” Blasband, 971 F.2d at 1040. That putative plaintiff must
have been a genuine stakeholder in the corporation, concurrent with any
alleged wrongdoing, and she or he must retain shareholder status throughout the course of derivative litigation. See id. at 1041; Lewis, 477 A.2d at
1046; see also 8 Del. C. § 327.
The “sole purpose” of this continuing ownership requirement is to prevent the “evil” of opportunistic plaintiffs from purchasing stock in a Delaware corporation simply “in order to maintain a derivative action designed
to attack a transaction which occurred prior to the purchase of the stock.”
Id. at 1040–41. The requirement that a derivative plaintiff retains shareholder status throughout the case “ensures that the plaintiff has sufﬁcient
incentive to represent adequately the corporation’s interests during litigation.” Id. at 1041. The presumptive legislative intent of these statutory provisions is to prevent abuse of the derivative action mechanism. Id. Delaware
law apparently does not, however, require the plaintiff to hold the entire
position in the stock of the corporation being sued derivatively throughout
the pendency of such litigation. This may be especially relevant where a
shareholder also contemplates a separate action for securities fraud and
might face somewhat competing issues, such as those which involve loss
causation. See, e.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, 544 U.S. 336.

FUTILITY EXCUSES THE DEMAND
REQUIREMENT
If a shareholder demand asserted on a corporation’s directors would be
pointless, or “futile,” the requirement of a demand letter is excused as a
matter of law, and a derivative action may proceed, provided futility is
“well-pleaded.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1; see also In re IAC/InterActive Corp
Sec. Litig., 478 F. Supp. 2d at 598. The primary purpose of the demand
requirement is to afford directors the “opportunity to examine the alleged
grievance and related facts and to determine whether pursuing the action is
in the best interest of the corporation.” Ryan, 918 A.2d at 352 n.20; see also
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1; Del. Ch. Ct. R. 23.1. However, directors might not

179

180

Pa rt i I TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

always be inclined to act in the best interest of a corporation in which a
putative shareholder-plaintiff holds a stake. One such example where a
shareholder might be excused due to demand futility is where “directors are
incapable of making an impartial decision regarding whether to institute
such litigation.” Stone, 911 A.2d at 366. Delaware courts have recognized
where “a question is rightfully raised over whether the board will pursue
these claims with 100% allegiance to the corporation, since doing so may
require that the board sue itself on behalf of the corporation,” a demand
may be excused due to futility. Ryan, 918 A.2d at 354.

FUTILITY, DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE, AND
BUSINESS JUDGMENT
The director of a Delaware corporation is presumed to be incapable of
acting objectively in the context of a shareholder demand if she or he is
“interested in the outcome of the litigation.” Grimes, 673 A.2d 1207;
see also In re eBay, Inc., 2004 WL 253521. Delaware courts consider a
“classic example[ ]” of director self-interest to be “a business transaction
involv[ing] either a director appearing on both sides of a transaction or [ ]
receiving a [ ] beneﬁt from a transaction not received by the shareholders
generally.” Berger, 2005 WL 2807415, at *6. Delaware law provides at
least “two instances where a plaintiff is excused from making demand.”
Ryan, 918 A.2d at 352. A shareholder can ﬁrst raise reasons that cast doubt
regarding the independence, or disinterest, of a majority of the corporation’s directors. Id.; Zimmerman, 2002 WL 31926608, at *7. For example,
where “three directors of a six person board are not independent and
three directors are independent, there is not a majority of independent
directors and demand would be futile.” Beam I, 845 A.2d at 1046 n.8; cf.
In re Oracle Corp., 824 A.2d 917.
A second manner in which a shareholder may be excused from the
required demand is to plead particularized reasons which raise reasonable
doubts that the corporate acts connected to the alleged wrongdoing were
not a product of the board’s valid exercise of business judgment. Ryan, 918
A.2d at 352; see also Del. Ch. Ct. R. 23.1. Courts generally respect the decisions made by corporate directors, unless a shareholder alleges a majority of
the directors lacked independence in relation to a contested decision, or
that certain directors are actually interested in the transaction(s) at issue,
and did “not act in good faith, act[ed] in a manner that cannot be attributed

c h a p t e r 1 2 t h e D e l awa r e D e r i vat i v e A c t i o n

to a rational business purpose, or reach[ed] their decision by a grossly negligent process that include[d] the failure to consider all material facts reasonably available.” Berger, 2005 WL 2807415, at *6.
A recent Delaware decision found a shareholder established demand
futility with pleading allegations that detailed wrongdoing committed by a
compensation committee of the nominal defendant corporation’s board of
directors, and where members of that compensation committee also constituted the board’s majority; the shareholder also raised sufﬁcient doubts
challenging whether the disputed transactions were actually the result of a
valid exercise of business judgment. Ryan, 918 A.2d at 354. Similarly, if
a board’s majority includes familial or material ﬁnancial interest(s); or if the
directors are for some other reason unable to act independently, such as
control or domination; or if it is otherwise established the “underlying
transaction is not the product of a valid exercise of business judgment,” the
putative plaintiff would be excused from the required pre-suit derivative
demand. Beam I, 845 A.2d at 1049.
A director is considered to be “interested,” in the derivative context, if it
can be demonstrated that she or he will incur a potential personal beneﬁt,
or avoid a detriment, that is not equally shared by the stockholder(s), as a
result of the outcome of a decision detailed in the derivative demand. Id.
Whether a director can exercise independent and good faith business judgment is often answered by analyzing the “personal consequences resulting
from the decision.” Id. The “primary basis” for measurement of the extent
(or lack) of a director’s independence is “whether the director’s decision is
based on the corporate merits of the subject before the board, rather than
extraneous considerations or inﬂuences.” Id. When a shareholder can show
that the majority of a board’s directors lack independence, no demand is
required and the shareholder may proceed with the litigation derivatively.

CONCLUSION
The corporate accountability mechanism of a Delaware derivative action
requires a shareholder to thoroughly investigate the facts related to alleged
wrongdoing and be duly diligent in obtaining all reasonably available information, utilizing various government and non-government sources, as well
as a Section 220 corporate books and records inspection demand. A Delaware corporation’s directors must discharge the duty to be fully informed
when making the decision of whether to refuse a shareholder demand, or to

181

182

Pa rt i I TE C H N IC A L T R A DING

initiate an action on behalf of the corporation, and must make that decision
as a good faith exercise of valid business judgment in order to withstand
subsequent challenges by the shareholder. A demand must be asserted for
what has been described as a “proper purpose.”
Directors who are “interested,” or who cannot be considered “independent,” need not be served with a shareholder demand, and if the majority of a
Delaware corporation’s board of directors cannot be construed as disinterested or independent, a shareholder can proceed directly to litigation, with
reliance on the doctrine of futility, excused of the condition precedent to
serve a derivative demand. However, judicial evaluations have differed greatly
regarding the question of the disinterest and/or independence of directors.
A shareholder must carry the burden of establishing reasonable doubt as
to director interest or dependence when seeking to be excused from the
demand requirement. A shareholder might be able to reduce the time that is
reasonable for a board to decide whether to accept or refuse a demand by
providing as much relevant factual detail as is reasonably possible about the
contested transactions and/or activities. Delaware courts undertake exacting
reviews of the factual complexities of a shareholder demand in order to
determine whether an action was initiated prematurely, and the outcome of
those evaluations can vary greatly, but the analysis is typically governed by
a rule of reason. The overall rigor required of shareholders also extends to
the degree of particularity that is expected of a derivative pleading, which
supports a policy of judicial economy by preventing meritless lawsuits that
might otherwise encumber the limited managerial resources of Delaware
corporations, to the potential detriment of its other shareholders.
The derivative action truly is an ingenious corporate accountabilit y
mechanism. When a shareholder discovers facts that indicate potential harm
has been brought upon the corporate form, it is unlike any other legal measure designed to empower shareholders. However, the many nuances of derivative litigation, and its particular pre-litigation requirements, are sometimes
steep obstacles aggrieved shareholders must navigate adroitly if they expect
that their derivative claim will ever see the interior of a courtroom.

Leveraged
Exchange-Traded
Funds and Their
Trading Strategies
Narat Charupat

ABSTRACT
Leveraged and leveraged inverse exchange-traded f unds (ETFs) are
designed to generate daily returns that are in multiples or negative multiples
of the daily returns on some benchmarks. Although these products are relatively recent, they have been the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. ETF
market. Due to the daily rebalancing of leverage employed, the returns on
these ETFs over any holding period longer than one day will deviate from
the stated multiples. This chapter examines the risk and return patterns of
several trading strategies.

INTRODUCTION
Leveraged and leveraged inverse exchange-traded funds (hereafter referred
to collectively as leveraged ETFs) are publicly traded mutual funds that
aim to generate daily returns that are in multiples or negative multiples of
the daily returns on some benchmarks. They were ﬁrst introduced in the
United States in 2006.1 Since then, this segment of the U.S. ETF market
has grown very quickly in terms of assets under management and trading
activity.

Pa rt I I i E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UND ST R ATE G I ES

Currently ( July 2009), there are over 100 leveraged ETFs traded on U.S.
exchanges, with assets totaling approximately $31 billion. The majority of
them (over 60 leveraged ETFs) are managed by ProShares and are listed on
the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). Other providers include Direxion
Funds and Rydex Investments. Typically, these ETFs offer returns that are
2, 3, 2, or 3 the benchmark returns.2 The benchmarks include
bond indexes, equit y indexes and subindexes, commodities and their
indexes, currencies, and real estate indexes.
Although leveraged ETFs currently account for only 5.35 percent of the
total ETFs market in terms of assets under management (i.e., $31 billion
out of $578 billion), their trading volume is disproportionately large at
37.18 percent of the total ETFs trading volume. One reason for this disproportion is that speculators (e.g., day traders), whose trading is typically
short-term in nature, are attracted by the embedded leverage. Another reason is that leveraged ETFs are designed to provide the speciﬁed leveraged
returns only on a daily basis. This is achieved by daily rebalancing the dollar
amount of leverage that they use.3 The daily rebalancing causes the returns
compounded over any holding period longer than one day to differ from
the promised ratios. As a result, any investors who want to hold these ETFs
for a long period will have to adjust their positions in the funds regularly to
counter the effect of the funds’ rebalancing. This leads to more trading
activity in the funds.
In this chapter, I examine the risk-return patterns of leveraged and leveraged inverse ETFs. I also discuss a few trading strategies for these funds.

TRADING STRATEGIES
Directional Trades
The most straightforward use of leveraged ETFs is for traders to express
their views on the directions of the movements of the underlying benchmarks. Individuals who believe that the prices of the underlying benchmarks
are moving up, can buy bull (e.g., 2 or 3) and/or short bear (e.g., 2
or 3) leveraged ETFs. Individuals who have the opposite opinions can
buy bear and/or short bull leveraged ETFs.
There are two related issues to keep in mind when using leveraged ETFs
in directional trades. First, as alluded to above, the compounded return
from holding these ETFs over a long horizon will be different from the
stated leverage ratio. Second, the compounded return from buying a bull

c h a p t e r 1 3 LE V ER A G ED E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UNDS

(bear) leveraged ETF will be different from shorting a bear (bull) leveraged
ETF on the same benchmark.
To see the reason why these two issues arise, note that a leveraged ETF
is designed to maintain its stated leverage ratios (such as 3 or 2 the
benchmark return) on a daily basis. This is so that traders can buy or sell it
on any day and get the promised ratio. To achieve this, the fund’s dollar
amount of leverage is adjusted daily to reﬂect the changes in the value of
the benchmark, so that the percentage of leverage is maintained.
For example, suppose a 2 leveraged ETF is started today where the
benchmark index is at 100. The fund would borrow 100 in order for its
total exposure to be 200. Then, if the benchmark goes up to 110 tomorrow
(i.e., a 10 percent increase), the value of the fund will now be 220, of which
120 belongs to the fund’s holders and 100 is owed to the lender. 4 As a
result, to maintain the 2 leveraged ratio going forward, the fund will need
to increase their borrowing to 120 to match the holders’ equity in the fund.
Vice versa, if instead of going up by 10 percent, the benchmark declines by
10 percent tomorrow, the value of the fund will now be 180, of which 80
belongs to the fund’s holders and 100 is owed to the lender. Therefore, to
maintain the 2 leveraged ratio going forward, the fund will need to
reduce their borrowing to 80 to match the holders’ equity in the fund.
The daily rebalancing of the fund’s exposure causes its compounded
return to deviate from its stated ratio. To illustrate this fact, Table 13.1 presents a simple two-day example of a 2 bull leveraged ETF under four
different return paths. Consider return path 1, where on day 1, the benchmark
index increases by 10 percent, and the next day it declines by 5 percent. Over
two days, the benchmark return is (1.1  0.95)  1  4.50 percent, causing
holders of this 2 ETF to think that they would get a 9 percent return on the
ETF. However, the actual returns are 20 percent for day 1 and –10 percent

for day 2, resulting in a two-day return of (1.20.9)  1  8 percent, which is
less than twice the benchmark return.5
The less volatile the underlying benchmark’s daily returns over the return
path, the higher the compounded returns will be. Consider return path 2,
where the benchmark return on each of the two days were 2.2252 percent
(i.e., zero volatility with the same two-day benchmark return as in path 1),
the compounded return of the 2 ETF would be 9.10 percent, which
exceeds twice the benchmark return.
The same conclusion obtains for the case where the benchmark declines
over the two days. Consider return paths 3 and 4. Under both paths, the
benchmark’s two-day return is 5.50 percent. However, under path 3
(where there is volatility), the 2 ETF’s return is 12 percent, which is
less than twice the benchmark return. On the other hand, under path 4
(where there is zero volatility), the 2 ETF’s return is 10.84 percent,
which is higher than twice the benchmark return.
Volatility has the same effects on bear leveraged ETFs. To see this, the
same calculations as in Table 13.1 are repeated for a 2 ETF. The
results are in Table 13.2. Here again, volatility causes ETF returns to be
lower. For example, under return path 3 (which is volatile), the benchmark’s two-day return is 5.50 percent, while the return on this bear
ETF is 8 percent, which is less than twice the negative of the benchmark
return (i.e., 11 percent). On the other hand, for return path 4, there is
no volatility and the ETF return is higher at 11.89 percent (which exceeds
twice the negative of the benchmark return).
Formally, deﬁne the compounded return over N days from holding a
leveraged ETF whose leveraged ratio is β as
N

rt ,t + N = ∏ (1 + β it + j −1,t + j ) − 1

(13.1)

where itj1,tj is the daily rate of return on the benchmark.6
It then follows that the payoff from investing $1 in a leveraged ETF over
N days is
N

(13.2)

j =1

which can be rewritten as

⎥⎦

j =1

(13.3)

Taking a second-order Taylor expansion of the right-hand side of Equation
(13.3) yields the following approximation7
⎡ 1

–
where i is the average of the benchmark’s daily return during the period, and
1 N
s2 =
∑ ( it+ j−1,t+ j − i )2 , is the sample variance of the daily returns.
N j =1
Equation (13.4) states that the N-day compounded return on a leveraged
ETF, rt,t+N, is equal to the compounded return based on the average benchmark return over the period multiplied by an exponential term. If there is
no volatility in the return path (i.e., s 2 = 0), the exponential term is equal to
one, and rt,t+N exceeds β times the benchmark’s compounded return. This
implies that in a steadily rising or steadily declining market, the N-day
return from a leveraged ETF will be greater than promised by the ratio.
On the other hand, when there is volatility in the return path, the exponential term is less than 1. The higher the volatility of the return path, the
lower will be the exponential term. Therefore, leveraged ETFs will perform poorly in a sideways market where the benchmark ﬂuctuates but does
not change by much over a given period. In addition, the higher the
absolute value of the multiple, the greater will be the impact of volatility.
Finally, it is clear from Tables 13.1 and 13.2 that the returns on bull and
bear leveraged ETFs are not the exact opposite of each other. For example,
suppose a trader buys both a 2 and a 2 ETF. Then, if return path 1

193

194

Pa rt I I i E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UND ST R ATE G I ES

occurs, the combined two-day return will be 4 percent, rather than zero.
This is due to the fact that daily returns on one ETF are the negative of
daily returns on the other. When these returns are compounded, the
resulting N-day returns are no longer the negative of one another.
One implication of this difference in returns is that a long position in a
bull (bear) ETF is not the same as a short position in a bear (bull) ETF over
any holding period longer than one day. Which position to use depends on
the trader’s belief regarding the direction and the volatility of the benchmark.
Consider ﬁrst the case where volatility is expected to be low. If a trader
believes that the benchmark is going to rise, he or she could either long the
bull-leveraged ETF or short the bear-leveraged ETF. However, it can be
shown that a long position in the bull ETF will perform better. This can
be seen from Equation (13.4). Consider an extreme case where volatility is
zero (i.e., S2  0). Then, the N-day return on a long position in a bullleveraged ETF with a leverage ratio of β, where β  0, is
rt , t + N = (1 + β i ) − 1
N

(13.5)

while the N-day return on a short position in a bear-leveraged ETF with a
leverage ratio of -β is
N
rt , t + N = − ⎡⎢(1 − β i ) − 1⎤⎥
⎣
⎦

(13.6)

–
It is straightforward to show that in a rising market (i.e., i  0), the return
in Equation (13.5) will be higher than the return in Equation (13.6).
Next, if the trader believes that the benchmark is going to decline, he or
she could either short the bull-leveraged ETF or long the bear-leveraged
ETF. If volatility is expected to be low, then a long position in the bear
ETF will perform better. Again, this can be shown by comparing the negative of the returns in Equations (13.5) and (13.6).
On the other hand, consider the case where volatility is expected to be
high. In this case, it is less clear-cut which strategy will be more proﬁtable.
For example, if the trader believes that the benchmark is going to rise, he or
she could buy a bull ETF or short a bear ETF. The N-day return on a long
position in a bull leveraged ETF with a leverage ratio of β is
⎡ 1

(13.8)

Given the leverage ratio β and the length of holding period N, the returns
in Equations (13.7) and (13.8) will depend on the magnitude of expected
–
return i and volatility s.
–
Theoretically, it can be shown that there are combinations of i and s
such that the return in Equation (13.7) exceeds the return in Equation
(13.8), and vice versa. However, for a realistically high volatilit y (say,
between 30 percent and 60 percent per annum) and a reasonable expected
rate of return (say, below 40 percent per annum), the return in Equation
(13.8) will always be higher (and thus shorting a bear ETF is better than
buying a bull ETF).
To see this, note that the returns in Equations (13.7) and (13.8) depend on
–
the product between compounded return based on i and an exponential term.
–
–
When, i  0, the compounded return in Equation (13.7) (i.e., (1  β i )N) is
–
greater than the compounded return in Equation (13.8) (i.e., (1  β i )N).
–
The higher the i, the greater is the difference. At the same time, the value of
the exponential term in Equation (13.8) is less than the value of the exponen–
tial term in Equation (13.7) for any i  0 and any non-zero volatility, s2. The
larger the volatility, the lower is the exponential term in Equation (13.8).
Therefore, positive expected return and high volatility affect the product of
–
the two terms in opposite directions. For reasonable values of i and s, the
effect of volatility is greater than the effect of expected return. As a result,
the return in Equation (13.8) is greater than in Equation (13.7).
Finally, if it is expected that the benchmark is going to drop and volatility will be high, then the same line of reasoning as above can be used to
show that shorting a bull ETF is a better strategy than buying a bear ETF.

Straddles
In option trading, a long (short) straddle involves buying (writing) a call and a
put options with the same exercise price and maturity date. A long straddle
will be proﬁtable if the underlying stock price becomes more volatile than
expected by the market and the price moves sufﬁciently far from the exercise

195

196

Pa rt I I i E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UND ST R ATE G I ES

price. A short straddle will be proﬁtable if the stock price moves in a narrow
range and ends up close to the exercise price. In other words, a straddle is a
trading strategy that traders use to express their beliefs about the volatility
and the size (but not the direction) of the underlying price movement.
In the context of leveraged ETFs, it has been suggested in several print
and Web media that a trader who wants to express his or her opinions on a
benchmark’s future volatility can use a long straddle—buying both a bull
and a bear-leveraged ETF on the benchmark, or a short straddle—shorting
both a bull and a bear ETFs.
Consider ﬁrst the case where a trader expects a period of low volatility.
If he or she buy a long straddles, the N-day return from this straddle in the
–
–
extreme case of zero volatility is [(1  β i ) N 1]  [(1  β i ) N 1], which
can be shown to be positive regardless of the direction and the size of the
underlying benchmark movement. The bigger the movement (in either
direction) and the longer the holding period, the higher is the return. Note,
however, that this strategy is very risky. If the benchmark is not expected to
change by much and/or volatility does not stay low, then the return from
this strategy may not be worth the risk of the investment. Therefore, this
strategy might be used only if the trader believes that the benchmarks will
steadily and signiﬁcantly move upward or downward.
Consider next the case where the benchmark’s volatility is expected to be
high. In this case, a short straddle will be proﬁtable if the benchmark ﬂuctuates but ends up close to where it begins. Recall from the discussion in
the previous section that leveraged ETFs perform poorly in a sideways
–
market. Hence, in such a market (e.g., i  0), the return from a short straddle will deﬁnitely be positive. The higher the volatility, the more positive is
the return.
In contrast, if the benchmark moves up or down signiﬁcantly, the return
from a short straddle will be low. The wider the move (in either direction),
the lower is the return. Indeed, the return from a short straddle can theo–
retically be negative. However, for realistic values of i and s, the return will
be positive, but may not be worth the risk of the investment.
In summary, a long straddle might be used if the benchmark is expected
to steadily and signiﬁcantly increase or decline. On the other hand, a short
straddle can be used if the benchmark is expected to be volatile but to not
move far from its original value. The risk of these two straddles is substantial and may not be merited by their payoffs.

CONCLUSION
In this short chapter, I discuss the risk and return patterns of investments in
leveraged ETFs. These ETFs attempt to provide daily returns that are in
multiples or negative multiples of the daily returns on some underlying
benchmarks. Due to the funds’ daily rebalancing of the amounts of leverage, the returns on these ETFs over a long holding period will deviate from
the promised ratio. Holding-period returns from a long position in a leveraged ETF will not be the same as the negative of the return from a short
position. This implies that buying (shorting) a bull ETF is not the same as
shorting (buying) a bear ETF. As a result, depending on traders’ expectation regarding the benchmark’s expected return and volatility, certain trading strategies will perform better than others over a long holding period
even if they are the same on a daily basis.

NOTES
1.

Leveraged mutual funds had been in existence long before 2006. However, they were not publicly traded.

2.

ETFs with greater leverage (such as 4 or 4) are currently being
considered.

3.

Hence, the percentage (not the dollar amount) of leverage is constant
from day to day.

For simplicity, the borrowing rate is assumed to be zero. The logic
does not change if a non-zero rate is used.

5.

It is obvious that the order of the daily returns in the path does not
matter.

Here, two assumptions are made. First, it is assumed that leveraged
ETFs have no tracking errors, which can be justiﬁed by the fact that
these funds typically use derivatives such as forward contracts or total
return swaps to achieve their desired returns. Second, their market
prices are assumed to match closely their NAVs. Empirical tests done
on traditional (i.e., non-leveraged) ETFs in the U.S. market show that
while deviations existed, they were generally small and highly transient,
especially when the underlying benchmarks are domestic indexes. See,
for example, Ackert and Tian (2008), Chu and Hsieh (2002), and Engle
and Sarkar (2006)

On the Impact of
Exchange-Traded
Funds over Noise
Trading
Evidence from European Stock Exchanges
Vasileios Kallinterakis and Sarvinjit Kaur

ABSTRACT
Exchange-traded funds bear properties that render them appealing to
rational investors in terms of trading and cost-effectiveness, thus raising the
possibility of their introduction bearing an adverse effect over the signiﬁcance of noise trading. We test for this hypothesis for the ﬁrst time in the
literature on the premises of the three largest European markets (France,
Germany, and the United Kingdom). Our results reveal that noise trading
is found to be insigniﬁcant in all three markets both before as well as after
the introduction of ETFs, with its insigniﬁcance manifesting itself also in
their ETF segments.

INTRODUCTION
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have constituted perhaps the most dynamically permeating innovation in capital markets during the last decade. In
strictly conceptual terms, their underlying investments aim at mimicking

199

200

Pa rt I I i E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UND ST R ATE G I ES

the composition of a predetermined benchmark (e.g., an index) whose performance they track; as these funds are publicly traded in stock exchanges
like normal equity, this endows investors with the unique opportunity of
trading an index through a single stock—the ETF. ETFs rose in prominence ﬁrst in the United States and Canada during the 1990s and later
experienced a phenomenal expansion since the years of the dot-com bubble
internationally. According to the U.S. Investment Company Institute,1 the
total value of managed ETF assets in the United States amounted to almost
half a trillion ($482,018 billion) U.S. dollars in March 2009 with the industry witnessing a proliﬁc expansion in European and Asian capital markets
since 2000. In view of the above developments, research in ﬁnance has
recently begun to exhibit a surging interest in the area with an increasing
number of studies focusing on the examination of ETF return-properties
(see Deville, 2008 for an excellent review).
An issue bearing interesting policymaking implications with regards to
ETFs relates to whether their introduction has born any effect over noise
trading in the underlying spot markets. ETFs aim at improving informational efﬁciency by fostering investor participation (Deville, 2008) through
their simplicity (they allow an index to be traded as a stock), cost-effectiveness (very low management fees), risk-diversiﬁcation (one ETF share provides exposure to all the stocks included in an index), and high liquidity
(they are traded by various investors as hedging instruments). If ETFs as a
product succeed in attracting rational investors, then this is expected to
translate in enhanced efﬁciency coupled with a reduction of noise trading at
the spot level, since ETF trades on their underlying benchmark stocks will
be motivated by a fundamentals-driven clientele. However, it is possible that
noise investors might be tempted to shift from the spot market to the ETF
one in order to take advantage of the ease and low cost of ETF transactions.2 If so, this would raise the potential for irrational trading in the
ETF market with large deviations of prices there from fundamentals (De
Long et al., 1990), thus implying that the anticipated beneﬁts from ETFs
over securities pricing at the spot level would fail to be realized.
Despite the obvious importance of the above from an investor’s as well as
a regulatory perspective, it is worth noting that the issue of the impact of
ETF introduction over noise trading has not been explored in the literature. We aim at covering this gap here by addressing this issue in a comparative context in order to obtain an improved insight; more speciﬁcally, our
investigation is undertaken on the premises of a sample comprised of the

c h a p t e r 1 4 E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UNDS a n d N o i s e T r a d i n g

French, German, and U.K. stock exchanges which constitute the largest
equity markets in Europe and which also maintain the longest standing and
most heavily traded ETF segments on the continent. Using an ad hoc heterogeneous traders’ empirical design, we examine the presence of noise
trading in those three markets’ spot segments prior to and after the introduction of ETFs, as well as its presence in their respective ETF segments.
The next sections will thus be devoted to the delineation of the methodological approach (and data) employed here; in the following section, we
shall embark on the presentation and discussion of our results.

DATA
Our data includes the daily closing prices of both the main spot market
indexes as well as their corresponding ETFs of the French, German, and
UK markets; the indexes involved here are the CAC 40, the DAX 30 and the
FTSE 100, respectively. The choice of these three markets relates to the fact
that they constitute the pioneers in the introduction of ETFs in Europe and
bear the most developed ETF markets on the continent. Since there usually
exists more than one ETF linked to a particular index in each market
(Deville, 2008), the ETF series used here are those of the ﬁrst ETFs linked
to that index. More speciﬁcally, our ETF sample includes the series (launchdate in brackets) of the iSHARES FTSE 100 (April 28, 2000), the DAXEX
( January 3, 2001), and the Lyxor ETF CAC 40 ( January 22, 2001). The
sample-window of each market assumes a period prior to the introduction of
the ETF equal in length to the period following its introduction (with the
post-introduction period ending on June 30, 2008 for all markets) to ensure
comparability between the two periods for each market.3 The pre- and postETF periods for each market therefore are: UK (April 10, 1992 to April 27,
2000; April 28, 2000 to June 30, 2008), France (August 13, 1993 to January
21, 2001; January 22, 2001 to June 30, 2008) and Germany ( July 8, 1993 to
January 2, 2001; January 3, 2001 to June 30, 2008). All data on spot indexes
and ETF closing prices were obtained from DataStream.

METHODOLOGY
To investigate the impact of the introduction of ETFs on noise trading, we
shall rely on the empirical framework introduced by Sentana and Wadhwani
(1992), which assumes two types of traders in the market, namely “rational

201

202

Pa rt I I i E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UND ST R ATE G I ES

speculators” and “feedback traders.” The demand function of the rational
speculators is as follows

Qt =

Et −1 ( rt ) − α
θ σ t2

(14.1)

where Q t represents the fraction of the shares outstanding of the ETF
(or, alternatively, the fraction of the market portfolio) held by those traders,
Et1(rt) is the expected return of period t given the information of period
t – 1, α is the risk-free rate (or else, the expected return such that Qt  0), θ
is a coefﬁcient measuring the degree of risk-aversion, and σ 2t is the conditional variance (risk) at time t. On the other hand, the demand function of
the feedback traders is
Y t = γ rt −1

(14.2)

where γ is the feedback coefﬁcient and rt1 is the return of the previous
period (t – 1) expressed as the difference of the natural logarithms of prices
at periods t – 1 and t – 2, respectively. A positive value of γ implies the presence of positive feedback trading (“trend-chasing”), while a negative value
indicates the presence of negative feedback trading (“contrarianism”). As all
shares must be held in equilibrium, we have
Qt + Yt = 1

(14.3)

Substituting the corresponding demand functions in Equation (14.3), we
have
Et −1 ( rt ) = α − γ rt −1θ σ 2t + θ σ t2

(14.4)

To transform Equation (14.4) into a regression equation, we set rt Et1(rt) 
εt, where εt is a stochastic error term and by substituting into Equation (14.4),
the latter becomes
rt = α − γ rt −1θ σ t2 + θ σ t2 + ε t

(14.5)

c h a p t e r 1 4 E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UNDS a n d N o i s e T r a d i n g

where rt represents the actual return at period t and εt is the error term. To
allow for autocorrelation due to nonsynchronous trading or market frictions,
Sentana and Wadhwani (1992) develop the following empirical version of
Equation (14.5)
rt = α + (φ0 + φ1 σ t2 )rt −1 + θ σ t2 + ε t

(14.6)

where φ 0 is designed to capture possible nonsynchronous trading effects and
φ1  θγ. Thus, a positive (negative) φ1 would indicate the presence of negative (positive) feedback trading. As Equation (14.5) shows, return autocorrelation in this model rises with the risk in the market (σ 2t ) as indicated by
the inclusion of the term γ rt1 θ σ 2t . If positive (negative) feedback traders
prevail, then the autocorrelation will be negative (positive). To control
for possible asymmetric behavior of feedback trading contingent on the
market’s direction, Sentana and Wadhwani (1992) extend Equation (14.6) as
follows
rt = α + (φ0 + φ1 σ t2 )rt −1 + θ σ t2 + ε t

(14.7)

As the Equation (14.7) suggests, positive values of φ 2 (φ 2  0) indicate
that positive feedback trading grows more signiﬁcant following market
declines as opposed to market upswings. Thus, the coefﬁcient on rt1 now
becomes

φ0 + φ1σ t2 + φ2 if

rt −1 ≥ 0

φ0 + φ1σ − φ2 if

rt −1 < 0

2
t

In order to test for feedback trading with the Sentana and Wadhwani
(1992) model, we have to specify the conditional variance (indicated by the
σ 2t ) in Equation (14.7). The conditional variance σ 2t is modeled here as an
asymmetric generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity process (Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle, 1993)
σ t2 = ω + β εt2−1 + γ σ t2−1 + δSt −1 εt2−1

(14.8)

203

204

Pa rt I I i E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UND ST R ATE G I ES

Here δ captures the asymmetric responses of volatility following positive
versus negative innovations. S t–1 is a binary variable equaling one if the
innovation at time t – 1 is negative and zero otherwise. If δ is positive and
statistically signiﬁcant, then negative innovations increase volatility more
that positive innovations. The aim here is to use a conditional variance
model capable of capturing the well-documented asymmetric effects of
volatility (Bollerslev, Engle, and Nelson, 1994) and allow us to examine any
link between those effects and the asymmetric behavior of feedback trading
tested through Equation (14.7).

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Descriptive statistics for the daily log-difference returns of the three market indexes and their corresponding ETFs are provided in Table 14.1. The
statistics reported are the mean, the standard deviation, measures for skewness and kurtosis, the normality test, and the Ljung–Box (LB) test statistic
for ﬁve lags. The skewness and kurtosis measures indicate departures from
normality (returns-series appear signiﬁcantly negatively skewed and highly
leptokurtic), something further conﬁrmed by the Jarque-Bera test. Rejection of normality can be partially attributed to temporal dependencies in
the moments of the series. The LB statistic is signiﬁcant,4 thus providing
evidence of temporal dependencies in the ﬁrst moment of the distribution
of returns, due to, for example, market inefﬁciencies. However, the LB
statistic is incapable of detecting any sign reversals in the autocorrelations
due to positive/negative feedback trading. It simply provides an indication
that ﬁrst-moment dependencies are present. Evidence on higher order temporal dependencies is provided by the LB statistic when applied to squared
returns. The latter is signiﬁcant and higher than the LB statistic calculated
for the returns, suggesting that higher moment temporal dependencies are
pronounced.

RESULTS; CONCLUSION
We begin the presentation of our results by estimating the set of Equation
(14.6) and Equation (14.8) for the spot market indexes prior to and after the
introduction of ETFs. It is interesting to note here the complete absence of
signiﬁcant feedback trading both before as well as after the introduction of
ETFs; more speciﬁcally, as Table 14.2 indicates, the feedback coefﬁcient

(φ1) is indicative of statistically insigniﬁcant positive feedback trading for all
tests, thus implying that noise investors do not bear a decisive presence in
our sample markets. Moreover, the φ 0 coefﬁcient is reﬂective of insigniﬁcant first-order autocorrelation (whose sign switches from positive to
negative in the aftermath of the introduction of ETFs), suggesting that
the spot markets in the UK, France, and Germany are characterized by
enhanced efﬁciency. Moving to the conditional variance process, we notice
that δ remains consistently positive and signiﬁcant throughout our tests,
thus suggesting that negative innovations tend to increase volatility more
than positive ones, something further conﬁrmed when calculating the
asymmetric ratio ( β  δ )/β .5 This volatility asymmetry appears more pronounced during the post-ETF period as indicated by the higher values of

c h a p t e r 1 4 E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UNDS a n d N o i s e T r a d i n g

the δ coefﬁcient (and the higher absolute values of the asymmetric ratio).6
What is more, volatility exhibits high persistence, as reﬂected through the
statistically signiﬁcant γ coefﬁcient, thus denoting the signiﬁcant impact of
lagged volatility over contemporaneous volatility. To illustrate this persistence, we calculate the volatility half-life as HL  ln (0.5)/ ln( β  γ  δ / 2),
in line with Harris and Pisedtasalasai (2006). Our results indicate that
volatility is highly persistent, with its persistence, however. exhibiting signs
of decline in the post-ETF period for all markets.
Repeating the above analysis using the set of Equation (14.7) and
Equation (14.8) to control for possible asymmetries in feedback trading
contingent on market direction, we notice (Table 14.3) a consistently negative (and insigniﬁcant) φ2 coefﬁcient which reveals the absence of any such
asymmetries. As the rest of the estimates reported in Table 14.3 are similar

to those reported previously in Table 14.2, this further confirms the
absence of signiﬁcant feedback trading pre- and post-ETF and also shows
that the documented volatilit y asymmetries cannot be associated with
asymmetries in the behavior of feedback traders.
To assess the signiﬁcance of the difference in feedback trading between
the two periods, we run the speciﬁcation proposed by Antoniou, Koutmos,
and Pericli (2005)
Rt = α + θ σ t2 + [φ0,1Dt + φ0,2 (1 − Dt )]Rt −1 + [φ1,1Dt + φ1.2 (1 − Dt )]σ 2 Rt −1 + εt (14.9)
σ t2 = β0,1 Dt + β0,2 (1 − Dt ) + β1 σ t2−1 + β2 εt2−1 + δSt −1εt2−1

(14.10)

where D t  1 for the pre-ETF period and D t  0 for the post-ETF
period. As the β0 estimates in Table 14.4 reveal, the average level of volatility appears to have signiﬁcantly (insigniﬁcantly, in the case of Germany)
declined post-ETF, a fact in line with the reduction in volatility persistence
illustrated in Tables 14.2 and 14.3. What is more, feedback trading is found
to be insigniﬁcant prior to and after the launch of the ETF segment in all
three markets with its presence being insigniﬁcantly different between the
two periods. The φ0 coefﬁcient furnishes us with the same sign-switch
reported in the previous tests (positive pre-, negative post-ETF), and
appears signiﬁcant only in the case of the German market post-ETF;
results from the t statistics support its signiﬁcant period-to-period difference in the case of the UK and France.
We ﬁnally turn our attention to the ETF level and repeat our tests for
the ETF series of our sample. According to Table 14.5, there is no evidence
of signiﬁcance surrounding feedback trading here either. Much like in
Tables 14.214.4, results here conﬁrm the presence of highly persistent
and asymmetric volatility while all ETFs are characterized by insigniﬁcantly negative ﬁrst-order autocorrelation, similar to the post-ETF estimates reported for spot indexes.
As the previous results indicate, Europe’s three largest capital markets
appear to accommodate largely insigniﬁcant feedback trading during the last
couple of decades. The introduction of ETFs did little to change this, more
so since feedback traders are found to be insigniﬁcant in that market segment as well. Although the advent of ETFs has coincided with structural

changes in spot volatility dynamics (decline of average volatility levels,
increase in volatility asymmetries, and decrease in its persistence), the fact
remains that the spot markets in Europe’s major stock exchanges exhibit
signs of enhanced efﬁciency and are dominated by rational investors both
before and after the ETF launch. The fact that this appears to be the case in
the ETF segments as well is particularly encouraging from a regulatory
viewpoint, as it suggests that ETFs have thus far managed to serve their
original purpose, namely, contribute towards the completeness and efﬁciency
of these markets. In view of the above results—and given that the ETF
industry has already begun to take off in emerging markets in recent
years—it would be worth extending the present study by investigating in the
future (as more data becomes available with time) how the introduction of
ETFs impacts on noise trading in these markets as well, more so given the
differential conditions typifying their institutional frameworks compared to
their developed counterparts.

than unity (in absolute terms) would thus suggest that negative innovations contribute more to market volatility than positive ones.

The switch in the sign of the asymmetric ratio post-ETF is due to the
directional change of volatility autocorrelation between the two subperiods; more specifically, contemporaneous volatilit y is found to
increase with lagged squared innovations pre-ETF, yet the inverse
occurs post-ETF as the switch in the sign of the volatility autocorrelation coefﬁcient (β) in Table 14.2 indicates.

Penetrating FixedIncome ExchangeTraded Funds
Gerasimos G. Rompotis

ABSTRACT
This chapter investigates various issues concerning the performance, the
trading premium, and trading activity of ﬁxed-income exchange-traded
funds (ETFs). Findings ﬁrst indicate that ETFs slightly underperform their
tracking indexes. Moreover, the results indicate that ETFs trade daily, on
average, at a premium to their net asset value. Regression analysis reveals
that the premium is strongly persistent on a daily basis. Further regression
analysis demonstrates that the premium is meaningful in determining
future returns. In particular, return is found to be positively and negatively
affected by the contemporaneous and lagged premium, respectively. Finally,
evidence on the positive relationship between trading volume and lagged
intraday volatility and premium are revealed.

INTRODUCTION
Apart from the equity-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), new types of
ETFs allocating funds in nonequity investments are now available. One
signiﬁcant category of these new ETFs is the ﬁxed-income ETFs. Fixedincome ETFs track the performance of ﬁxed-income securities. In a stock
ETF, the fund is generally composed of all the stocks in the index. However,

213

214

Pa rt I I i E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UND ST R ATE G I ES

this is not the case in most bond ETFs. The fund holds a fraction of the
bonds that make up the underlying index. Bond prices are relatively straightforward being a function of the risk-free rate, the coupon, the quality of the
bond, and the years to maturity.
Fixed-income ETFs may track broad bond market indexes containing a
broad mix of both government and corporate bonds at different maturities.
Furthermore, ﬁxed-income ETFs may invest in treasury bonds based on
different maturities along the yield curve. Moreover, there are the treasury
inﬂation protected securities ETFs (TIPS) which pay interest equal to the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus a premium. They provide a hedge against
inﬂation and are designed to outperform regular bonds when inﬂation
expectation rises. Another type of ﬁxed-income ETFs relates to those that
invest in different asset classes allowing investors to get a fully diversiﬁed
portfolio by just buying an ETF. Finally, there is the target date or lifecycle
ETFs that target the deﬁned contribution pension plan market. Target date
funds are similar to balanced asset allocation funds having one additional
feature, namely, they become more conservative as they approach the target
date. Funds reduce risk by selling stocks and buying bonds as the target
date approaches.
Bond ETFs can be as liquid and transparent as stock ETFs, offering
investors the ﬂexibility of trading stocks along with the beneﬁts on investing in bonds. Fixed-income ETFs moves just like stocks, they can be intraday traded and can be sold short at any time throughout the trading day.
In contrast, bond mutual funds only trade at the end of the trading day,
making the bond ETF more liquid than a bond mutual fund.
The main similarities between bonds and ﬁxed-income ETFs are that
they are affected by the same factors such as the ﬂuctuations in interest
rates, variations in yield spreads, and changes in yield curves. The effects of
interest rates on bond prices are especially severe during the periods of
ﬁnancial and banking crisis. As a matter of fact, the current crisis has
resulted in increases in the “spreads” or the premium which large corporations pay to borrow money by issuing bonds to investors. On the other
hand, the basic differences between ﬁxed-income ETFs and bonds are that
the ETFs usually distribute dividends on a monthly basis, while bonds usually pay interest twice a year. Furthermore, bond ETFs have no maturity
date while bonds do. In addition, the income received by ETFs on the
bonds included in their portfolio are reinvested in new bonds rather than
returned to investors. Moreover, ETFs trade on stock exchanges, whereas

c h a p t e r 1 5 P ENET R AT ING F I X ED - IN COM E E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UNDS

bonds are generally bought and sold through dealer ﬁrms. Finally, individual investors can execute active trading strategies with ETFs that may be
difﬁcult to apply by using bonds themselves. Short selling is such an example. The same patterns apply when comparing bond ETFs with open-ended
ﬁxed-income mutual funds.
Going further, there are differences between ETFs and open-ended
ﬁxed-income mutual funds. Apart from the trading on stock exchanges and
the execution of active investing strategies and intraday trading orders mentioned above, ETF investors pay transaction fees to brokerage ﬁrms while
mutual fund investors do not. In addition, with mutual funds investors pay
purchase and redemption fees when they enter or exit the fund, while ETF
investors do not have to pay such fees. Moreover, the majority of openended mutual funds are actively managed and, as a result, they tend to
impose higher management fees than the passively managed ETFs. Apart
from their unique advantages, the ﬁxed-income ETFs are also subject to
some signiﬁcant weaknesses (described in Mazzilli, Maister, and Perlman
(2008)). One disadvantage is that the bond ETFs do not mature, which
means that when an investor decides to redeem their ETF shares, it may be
at a price that is lower than the initial investment. In addition, the determination of the exact yield for ﬁxed-income ETFs can be difﬁcult. Tracking
failure is another potential disadvantage of bond ETFs, while noncurrent
trading hours may also occur between the bond ETFs and their holdings.
In this chapter, we examine various issues concerning the performance of
ﬁxed-income ETFs, the replication efﬁciency, the premium, the relationship between premium and return, and the determinative factors of trading
activity. At ﬁrst, the results show that ﬁxed-income ETFs underperform
their benchmarks. Going further, the ﬁndings demonstrate that ﬁxedincome ETFs trade, on average, at a persistent premium to their net asset
value (NAV). Regression analysis reveals that the premium is indicative of
future returns. Finally, evidence of the positive relationship between trading volume and lagged intraday volatility and premium is found.

METHODOLOGY
Performance and Risk
Returns of ETFs are calculated using both their NAV and the trading
prices. Daily returns are estimated in percentage terms, while the risk is the
standard deviation of daily returns. A second performance measure we

215

216

Pa rt I I i E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UND ST R ATE G I ES

apply is tracking error, which indicates the return difference between ETFs
and indexes. Two tracking error measures are employed. The ﬁrst one
(TE1) concerns the difference in returns between ETFs and indexes
and the second one (TE2) estimates tracking error as the standard deviation in return differences between ETFs and indexes (found in Frino and
Gallagher, 2001).

Premium and Persistence of Premium
We ﬁrst estimate premium as the dollar difference between the closing
price and NAV and then as the percentage deviation between ETF closing
prices and NAVs. In general, one key feature of ETFs is the chances they
offer institutional investors to execute proﬁtable arbitrage strategies, which
in turn contribute to the sharp elimination of premiums or discounts in
trading prices. To verify this argument, we search for persistence patterns
in ﬁxed-income ETF premiums. We follow the approach of Elton et al.
(2002) and regress the premium (either the dollar or the percentage) of
iShares on day t against the premium on day t  1. The model we apply is
represented in Equation (15.1).
Premium t  α  β Premiumt 1  ε

(15.1)

Explaining Return
According to Jares and Lavin (2004), there is a signiﬁcant connection
between return and premium for Japan and Hong Kong iShares. More
speciﬁcally, the authors ﬁnd a strong and signiﬁcantly negative relationship
between return and contemporaneous premium and a signiﬁcantly positive
relation between return and lagged premium. On the contrary, Cherry
(2004) ﬁnds that ETF return is negatively related to lagged premium. The
ﬁndings of these studies suggest that premiums are meaningful for the
determination of future returns of ETFs.
We investigate the relation between the premium and return of ﬁxedincome ETFs, applying a time-series regression of each ETF return on the
contemporaneous and lagged premium (premium on day t and day t  1,
respectively). The model we estimate is shown in Equation (15.2).

c h a p t e r 1 5 P ENET R AT ING F I X ED - IN COM E E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UNDS

Explaining Volume
Elton et al. (2002) demonstrate that the trading volume of Standard &
Poor’s Depositary Receipts (SPDRs), which track the S&P 500 Index, is
signiﬁcantly affected by the lagged premium and lagged intraday volatility
estimated as the fraction of the intraday highest price minus the intraday
lowest price of the tracking index divided by the closing price of index.
Lagged values of volatility and premium are considered since the difference
between the price and NAV is calculated at the end of the day and, therefore, the difference signals (if any) arbitrage opportunities the next day.
We search whether Elton et al. (2002) regression analysis of volume
applies to ﬁxed-income ETFs by using the intraday volatility of ETFs
themselves and not the intraday price volatility of indexes. The model we
apply is represented by Equation (15.3).

DATA AND STATISTICS
In this chapter we use ETF trading data that cover the period July 29, 2002
to February 27, 2009. Our data consists of the closing prices, which are the
4 p.m. bid/ask midpoint, and the NAVs of a sample of 35 ﬁxed-income Barclay’s iShares. The 22 ETFs of the sample are bond funds tracking various
broad market, treasury, government credit, credit, municipal, mortgage,
and international bond indexes; and 13 are specialty ETFs which track various asset allocation, target date (pension market), and preferred stock
indexes. The closing prices of iShares were gathered from Nasdaq.com.
Nasdaq.com also provided us with the daily volumes of ETFs. The daily
NAVs were found on the Website of iShares (www.us.ishares.com).
Table 15.1 reports information concerning the symbol of the sample’s
ETFs, name, type, inception date, expense ratio, intraday volatility, and
average daily volume. The average expense ratio of ETFs is equal to 24 bps
reﬂecting the low managerial expenses charged by ETFs as a result of their
passive investing character. Furthermore, the average intraday volatility is
equal to 1.281 percent, while the average daily volume approximates the
116,000 shares. However, it should be noted that there are signiﬁcant variations among the individual average volumes. Indicatively, the maximum
average daily volume of the sample amounts to 1.3 million shares while the
minimum volume is equal to 383 shares.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Performance and Risk
Table 15.2 presents the average returns and risks of ETFs and indexes.
The average NAV return is negative and equal to minus 5.2 bps. The
corresponding average return of indexes is equal to minus 3.8 bps. Comparing average returns, we infer that the ETFs slightly underperform their
benchmarks. The underperformance of ﬁxed-income ETFs revealed by
our ﬁndings is consistent with the respective underperformance reported
by Svetina and Wahal (2008). When it comes to risk, results show that
there is no significant difference between the volatilit y of ETFs and
indexes. Considering the price returns, the results indicate that the ETFs
still underperform the indexes. More speciﬁcally, the average return of
ETFs is equal to 4.3 bps. With regard to risk, the average standard
deviation of price returns is equal to 1.174, being higher than the corresponding risk estimation of indexes, which is equal to 0.944.
The next exhibit presents the return and risk calculations of ETFs and
the tracking indexes. Return is the average daily return and risk is the standard deviation of daily return. Calculations are presented in two vertical
panels. Panel A presents returns and risks when NAVs are used, while Panel
B presets returns and risks in trading prices terms. N represents the number of daily observations.
Tracking errors are displayed in Table 15.3. The average TE1 of ETFs
is equal to 1.4 bps. Considering the statistical signiﬁcance of tracking
error estimates, the applied t tests indicate that the estimates are signiﬁcant
for 17 out of 35. The TE2 of ETFs in NAV terms is equal to 11.5 bps.
With respect to price returns, the average TE1 is essentially equal to zero
while only 8 out of the 35 individual tracking error estimates are statistically indifferent from zero. However, the average TE2 of ETFs is considerable being equal to 1.215 showing that the difference between the price
returns of ETFs and indexes are more volatile relative to the corresponding
relationship in NAV terms.

Premium and Persistence of Premium
Table 15.4 presents the average daily premiums of ETFs. The standard deviation in daily premiums is also reported in the exhibit. Results demonstrate
that, on average, the ﬁxed-income ETFs trade at a premium to their NAV.

Table 15.3 Tracking Error of ETFs
The following exhibit presents the calculations of ETF tracking error, which represents the
difference in performance between ETFs and tracking indexes. Two alternative tracking error
estimations are used. The ﬁrst one (TE1) concerns the average raw return difference between
ETFs and indexes and the second one (TE2) estimates tracking error as the standard deviations
in daily return differences between ETFs and indexes. In addition, t test values on the statistical
signiﬁcance of raw returns’ difference are presented. Calculations are presented in two vertical
panels. Panel A presents tracking error when NAV returns are used in estimating ETF returns,
while Panel B shows tracking error when ETF returns are calculated in trading price terms.

Table 15.4 Premium in Prices of ETFs
This next exhibit presents the calculations of ETF average daily premium along with the
standard deviation of daily premium. Premium is estimated both in dollar terms, by subtracting
the closing NAV of ETFs on day t from the closing trading price on the same day, and in
percentage terms, by dividing the difference between the closing trading price and closing NAV
by the closing NAV. Calculations are presented in two vertical panels. Panel A presents the
pecuniary premium and Panel B presents the percentage premium.

The average dollar premium is equal to 37.2 cent while the respective percentage premium is equal to 0.548 percent. The respective premium’s
volatilities are equal to 0.634 and 1.314. Earlier ﬁndings of the literature on
equity ETFs also reveal that ETFs trade at prices that are different from
their NAV. In particular, Hughen (2003) reports that Malaysia iShares trade
at a premium to its net value. Jares and Lavin (2004) ﬁnd similar results for
the Japan and Hong Kong iShares. On the contrary, Elton et al. (2002)
report that SPDRs trade at a discount to its NAV.
The results of the regression analysis are reported in Table 15.5. The
average slope coefficient for the dollar premium is positive and equal
to 0.486. The majority of individual betas (27 out of 35 beta estimates) are
positive and signiﬁcant. The same pattern applies to the percentage premium. The average beta estimate is equal to 0.489 while 26 single beta
coefﬁcients are positive and signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level or better.
Overall, our results contrast those of Elton et al. (2002) and indicate that the
premium of ﬁxed-income ETFs is sufﬁciently persistent on a daily basis,
implying limitations to the execution of arbitrage.

Explaining Return
Table 15.6 provides the results of Equation (15.2) on the relationship
between return and premium. Results provide sound evidence on the positive relationship between return and contemporaneous premium and the
negative impact of lagged premium on return. The average estimate of contemporaneous premium is equal to 0.781, while all the single estimations
are positive and statistically signiﬁcant. The positive average estimation
implies that an increase in contemporaneous premium by 1 unit results in
an increase in ETF return by 0.781 percent on the same day.
With respect to the relationship between the lagged premium and return,
the results provide strong evidence on the negative correlation between
these two factors. The relevant average coefﬁcient of the model is equal to
0.664. In addition, the majority of the single estimates are negative (only
one is positive but insigniﬁcant) while 31 out of the 34 negative estimations
are signiﬁcant. Our ﬁndings are in line with the ones reported by Cherry
(2004) about equity ETFs (he estimates an average beta of 0.680). Overall,
our results make us reject the efﬁcient market hypothesis for ﬁxed-income
ETFs and reveal possible opportunities for investors to exploit the premium
in ETF trading prices and execute proﬁtable arbitrage strategies.

Table 15.5 Persistence in Premium
The following exhibit presents the results of a time-series regression model which searches for persistence patterns in iShares’ premium. Speciﬁcally, the
premium of ETFs on day t  1 is regressed on the premium on day t. Model is applied to the pecuniary premium (Panel A) and the percentage premium
(Panel B).

Explaining Volume
Regression results of Equation (15.3) on the explanatory variables of ETF
volume are presented in Table 15.7. According to the results, the average
volatility’s coefﬁcient is positive and equal to 0.509 and the average premium’s estimate is also positive and equal to 0.305. With respect to the single estimates of the control variables, there are three negative volatility’s
estimates, of which only one is signiﬁcant. Moreover, there are 21 (out of 33)
positive volatility’s coefﬁcients that are signiﬁcant. Considering the relevant
ﬁgures of premium, there are 8 negative estimates (4 statistically signiﬁcant)
and 27 positive estimations (27 signiﬁcant). A last signiﬁcant ﬁnding concerns the intercept of the model, whose estimates are positive and strongly
signiﬁcant.
Overall, our results about the impact of lagged trading volatility and
premium on volume are in line with those of Elton et al. (2002). With
respect to the constant, Elton et al. (2002) report a negative estimate which
is close to zero, while we estimate sizeable constant coefﬁcients. Big intercepts indicate that there is a signiﬁcant proportion of shares that are constantly traded regardless of the inﬂuence of lagged volatility and premium.
This investing interest is probably related to the trading convenience, the
ﬂexibility in executing intraday orders, the tax efﬁciency, and the liquidity
of ETFs.

CONCLUSION
This chapter sheds light on various issues surrounding the performance of
ﬁxed-income ETFs, the premium in trading prices, and their trading
activity. These issues are examined employing a sample of 35 ﬁxed-income
iShares available on Nasdaq.com. Results indicate that, on average, ﬁxedincome ETFs underperform their tracking indexes. Underperformance
applies both to NAV and trading price returns, driving to significant
tracking error calculations.
Going further, the ﬁndings of the chapter demonstrate that the ﬁxedincome ETFs trade, on average, at a premium to their NAV which amounts
to $0.372 or 54.8 bps. Time-series regression analysis demonstrates that
premium is strongly persistent on a day-by-day basis, which reﬂects restrictions to the execution of arbitrage strategies that could sharply make the
premium vanish.

Moreover, the chapter reveals that the premium is indicative for future
ret urns. More specifically, findings indicate that ret urn is positively
related to the contemporaneous premium while it is negatively affected by
the one lagged premium. These ﬁndings imply that the ﬁxed-income ETF
market is not totally efﬁcient and may offer investors opportunities to
gain abnormal returns.
Finally, sound evidence on the positive relationship between trading volume and lagged intraday volatility and premium are revealed. The majority of
individual volatility and premium estimates are positive and signiﬁcant, indicating that investors make their trading decisions in response, among other
factors, to the price volatility and premium on the previous trading day.

Smooth Transition
Autoregressive
Models for the Dayof-the-Week Effect
An Application to the S&P 500 Index
Eleftherios Giovanis

ABSTRACT
This chapter examines the day-of-the-week effect for the S&P 500 index.
More speciﬁcally, OLS, GARCH (1,1), and EGARCH (1,1) estimations
with and without bootstrapping simulations provide that there is the
day-of-the-week effect. On the contrary, we examine the S&P index for
linearities against nonlinearities. We accept that there are nonlinearities and
we choose the ESTAR model based on a speciﬁc test and we ﬁnd that, with
ESTAR-GARCH (1,1) estimation, with and without bootstraping simulation, there is the day-of-the-week effect in the middle regime, while there
is none in the outer regime, where higher average returns are presented on
Mondays.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, we examine the well-known day-of-the-week effect. The
ﬁrst method we use is ordinary least squares (OLS); the second is the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) method, in

233

234

Pa rt i I I E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UND ST R ATE G I ES

order to solve for autocorrelation and ARCH effect; and the third method
is the exponential GARCH, or EGARCH, model allowing for leverage
effects. The latter two models are able to capture volatility and ARCH
effects, but the disadvantage is that they are unable to estimate nonlinearities for different regimes. The three most popular models that have been
proposed for nonlinear estimation are the threshold autoregressive (TAR)
model (Tong, 1990), the smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models
(Chan and Tong, 1986), and Markov-switching regime autoregressive
(MS-AR) model (Hamilton, 1989). TAR and MS-AR models assume a
sharp switch between regimes, while STAR models assume a smooth
switching. The reasons why we prefer the STAR models is that they allow
for smooth transition and switching between regimes because this fact
might be more realistic as it might be highly impossible that all agents act
and react simultaneously to a given economic and trading signal.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Many research papers have been written testing the day-of-the-week effect.
A mong them is the paper of Aggarwal and Tandon (1994), who test
the day-of-the week effect and ﬁnd that Monday returns are negative in
13 countries, but are signiﬁcant only in seven of them. Lakonishok and
Smidt (1988) ﬁnd persistently negative and signiﬁcantly different from zero
Monday average returns, while Mills et al. (2000) observe a Tuesday effect,
rather than a Monday effect on the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE). Draper
and Paudyal (2002) examine the FTSE All-Share and FTSE 100 indexes
and they ﬁnd that Monday average returns are negative and generally the
returns of the other four days of the week are signiﬁcantly higher.
The ﬁrst studies in the day-of-the week effect report signiﬁcant negative
average returns on Mondays. But more recent studies ﬁnd a shift in the
weekday pattern, where average returns on Mondays were no longer negative, but researchers discovered positive and signiﬁcantly different average
returns on Monday than the other weekday returns (Mehdian and Perry,
2001; Pettengill, 2003). Furthermore, Alagidede and Panagiotidis (2009)
examine the Ghana Stock Exchange and the day-of-the-week effect
hypothesis is rejected. Furthermore, Friday’s returns are the most signiﬁcant when asymmetric GARCH is estimated, but this seasonal anomaly
seems to disappear when the time-var ying asy mmetric GARCH is
employed. In a recent study, Onyuma (2009) examines the NSE 20 Share

Index of the Kenyan Stock Market using regression analysis and ﬁnds that
Mondays and Fridays present the lowest negative and highest positive
returns, respectively. In addition, Alagidede (2008) rejects the day-of-theweek effect in Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, and Tunisia, but ﬁnds higher positive ret urns on Friday in Zimbabwe. Kenourgios and Samitas (2008)
examine the day-of-the-week effect for the ASE indexes and uncover that
this anomaly is presented in the period 1995 to 2000, but it decreases in
strength after Greece’s entry into the Eurozone.
A few papers study smooth transition autoregressive models in stock
returns. In an older study Aslanidis (2002) examines smooth transition
regressive models using ﬁnancial and macroeconomic time-series, allowing
the transition variable to be either a past value of the dependent variable or
of an exogenous variable and he finds that in-sample movements are
explained and described in a more efﬁcient way by smooth transition models rather than by linear models. Moreover, McMillan (2003) examines
FTSE All-Share index returns using ﬁnancial and macroeconomic series
and suggests that nonlinear STAR models more efﬁciently describe the
dynamic behavior of the market.

METHODOLOGY
Deﬁnition of Ordinary Least Squares Model
for the Day-of-the-Week Effect
The stock returns are given by Equation (16.1).
Rt = log( Pt − Pt −1 )

(16.1)

For the day-of-the week effect, we apply the following model estimated
with OLS:
Rt = β1DMON + β2DTUE + β3DWED + β4 DTHU + β5 DFRI + γ Rt −1 + ε t

(16.2)

where Rt is deﬁned as in Equation (16.1), dummy variable DMON takes a
value of 1 if returns are on Mondays and 0 otherwise, and so on; and εt is
the disturbance term. We obtain the autoregressive term Rt1 in Equation
(16.2) to correct for possible nonsynchronous trading.

Deﬁnition of GARCH (1,1) Model for the
Day-of-the-Week Effect
We test in Equation (16.2) if there are ARCH effects, applying ARCH-LM
test (Engle, 1982). If there are ARCH effects we apply the symmetric
GARCH (1,1) model proposed by Bollerslev (1986), whereby the variance
equation is deﬁned as

σ t2 = ω + a1 ut2−1 + a2σ t2−1

(16.3)

The mean equation remains the same as in Equation (16.2). The standard
GARCH model is symmetric in its response to past innovations. Since
good news and bad news may have different effects on the volatility, we
consider an alternative GARCH model in an attempt to capture the asymmetric nature of volatility responses.

Deﬁnition of EGARCH (1,1) Model for the
Day-of-the-Week Effect
The asymmetric GARCH model we estimate is the EGARCH model,
which was proposed by Nelson (1991) and has the following form:

log (σ t2 ) = ω + log a1 (σ t2−1 ) + a2

⎡ u
2⎤
⎥
+ δ ⎢ t −1 −
π ⎥⎦
⎢⎣ σ t2−1
σ t2−1

ut −1

(16.4)

We expect for the asymmetries allowed ﬁnding a negative value for coefﬁcient γ if the relationship between volatility and returns is negative. More
speciﬁcally, it is expected γ  0, so “good news” generates less volatility
than “bad news,” where γ reﬂects the leverage effect.

Deﬁnition of STAR Models for the
Day-of-the-Week Effect
Smooth transition autoregressive models were introduced and developed by
Chan and Tong (1986) and is deﬁned as
Rt = π10 + π1 ' wt + ( π 20 + π 2' wt ) F ( Rt −d ; γ , c ) + ut

(16.5)

c h a p t e r 1 6 A U TOR E GR ES SI V E MO DE LS f o r t h e D ay o f t h e W e e k

where ut ~ (0,σ2), π10 and π20 are the intercepts in the middle and outer
regime respectively, wt  (Rt1 . . . Rtj ) is the vector of the explanatory
variables consisting of the dependent variable with j  1 . . . p lags, Rtd is
the transition variable, parameter c is the threshold giving the location of
the transition function, and parameter γ is the slope of the transition function. We shall consider two transition functions (Teräsvirta and Anderson,
1992), the logistic and the exponential, as deﬁned by Equation (16.6) and
Equation (16.7), respectively. Parameter d indicates the delay and we divide
parameter γ with σ (r), which is the standard deviation of Rt. First we apply
a test to examine if Rt is linear or not, proposed by Teräsvirta, Lin, and
Granger (1993). The STAR models estimation consists of three steps
(Teräsvirta, 1994).
F(Rtd)  (1  exp[γ (1 / σ (r))(Rtd  c)])1, γ  0

(16.6)

F(Rtd)  1 exp(γ (1/σ 2 (r))(Rtd  c)2), γ  0

(16.7)

The first step is the specification of the autoregressive process of
j  1 . . . p. In order to ﬁnd j value, we estimate the auxiliary regression in
Equation (16.8) for various values of j  1 . . . p, and we select that value
for which the p value is the minimum. Also the maximum value for p is set
up at 5. The second step is testing linearity for different values of delay
parameter d. We then estimate the following auxiliary regression:
p

p

p

j =1

j =1

j =1

Rt = βo + β1wt + ..... + ∑ β2 j Rt − j Rt −d + ∑ β3 j Rt − j Rt2−d + ∑ β4 j Rt − j Rt3−d + ε t (16.8)

The null hypothesis of linearity is H0: β 2j  β3j  β4 j  0. In order to
specify the parameter d the estimation of Equation (16.8) is carried out for
a wide range of values 1
d
D and we choose d  1, . . . 9 in a similar
process as we follow with the computation of value j. The third and last
step is the speciﬁcation of STAR model. We test the following hypotheses
(Teräsvirta and Anderson, 1992):
H 04 : β 4 j  0, j  1 , . . . , p

(16.9)

H 03 : β 3 j  0 | β 4 j  0, j  1 , . . . , p

(16.10)

H 02 : β 2 j  0 | β 3 j  β 4 j  0, j  1 , . . . , p

(16.11)

If we reject the hypothesis made in Equation (16.9), then we choose the
logistic STAR (LSTAR) model. If Equation (16.9) is accepted and Equation
(16.10) is rejected, then the exponential STAR (ESTAR) model is selected.
Finally, accepting Equation (16.9) and Equation (16.10) and rejecting Equation (16.11), we choose the LSTAR model. Thereafter, when we have
found the order of d from Equation (16.8) and j values and the speciﬁcation
of STAR model, we estimate the corresponding smooth transition autoregressive model for the day-of-the-week effect. Equation (16.5) becomes
Rt  π1 ′wt  β1 DMON  β2 DTUE  β3 DWED  β4 DTHU
 β5 DFRI  (π2 wt  γ1 DMON  γ2 DWED  γ3 DWED
 γ4 DTHU  γ5 DFRI ) F (Rt  d; γ, c)  ut

(16.12)

where ut follows GARCH (1,1) processes as we noted in a previous section.
We exclude π10 and π20 intercepts to avoid multicollinearity problem. In
order to compute the values of parameters c and γ, we apply a grid search in
relation to Equation (16.6) or Equation (16.7) with nonlinear least squares
and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The model Equation (16.12), we
propose, has the ﬂexibility that dummy variables in the outer regime no
longer take values of zero and unit. It is ver y close to a f uzzy logic
approach, where there is a different weighting in each observation and so in
each point of time.

Bootstrapping Regressions
We estimate the above models with and without bootstrapping simulation.
In all cases the steps for the bootstrapping simulated regression are the
same and we follow the process described in Davidson and MacKinnon
(2004). The bootstrapping replications have been set up at 1,000.

DATA
The data are daily and cover the period January 4, 1950 to March 31,
2009. The subperiod January 4, 1950 to December 31, 2008 is selected for

c h a p t e r 1 6 A U TOR E GR ES SI V E MO DE LS f o r t h e D ay o f t h e W e e k

estimating purpose and therefore is used for in-sample forecasting. The
remaining period January 2 through March 31, 2009 is used as the out-ofsample forecasting period.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Ordinary Least Squares Results
In Table 16.1, the regression results for the day-of-the-week effect with the
OLS method are reported. We observe that average returns on Monday are
negative, while the average returns on the other days of the week are positive. All estimated coefﬁcients are statistically signiﬁcant except from the
coefﬁcient indicating Thursday returns. Furthermore, the higher average
returns are not presented on Fridays, as expected, but they are reported on
Wednesdays with no bootstrapping simulations, while higher returns are
presented on Fridays with bootstrapping regression. The main problem
with OLS estimation is that autocorrelation and ARCH effects are not
eliminated, according to p values of the respective tests, LBQ2 and ARCHLM, while in bootstrapping regression these problems are solved. In both
estimations we reject the null hypothesis of regression coefﬁcients equality,
according to F statistic.

Generalized Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroscedasticity—GARCH Results
In Table 16.2, the situation is quite different with GARCH (1,1) estimation: while there are negative returns on Mondays, the highest returns are
reported on Fridays and not on Wednesdays, as we found with OLS.
According to the log-likelihood statistic, the Akaike information criteria,
and the Schwarz information criteria, GARCH (1,1) has greater estimating
performance. Furthermore, autocorrelation and ARCH effects are eliminated in both estimations. According to F statistic, we reject the hypothesis
that the estimated coefﬁcients are equal in both estimations. With this procedure, the day-of-the-week effect exists, as negative average returns and
the highest positive average returns are reported on Mondays and Fridays,
respectively.

Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroscedasticity—EGARCH Results
With EGARCH (1,1) estimation we obtain quite similar results and conclusions with those of GARCH (1,1), where negative average returns are
reported only on Mondays, and Fridays presents the highest average
returns (Table 16.3). Furthermore, bootstrapping regression presents
lower values for the information criteria and the log-likelihood statistic,
which means that based on these values, the EGARCH (1,1) model without bootstrapping simulation is preferred. Also the coefﬁcient δ, indicating the leverage effects, has negative and correct sign and it is statistically
signiﬁcant in EGARCH (1,1) without bootstrapping simulation, while
with bootstrapping regression, coefﬁcient δ has the correct sign but is
statistically insigniﬁcant.

Linearity Tests and Speciﬁcation of STAR Model
In this section, we provide the results of the linearity tests and STAR
model speciﬁcation. According to the Akaike information criteria and the
statistical signiﬁcance of AR( p) process, the value of j which is chosen is
equal to 2. The value for delay d is chosen based on the minimum p value
for which the linearity hypothesis is rejected. Because we have four values
for the delay parameter for which the minimum p value is obtained, we
AQ1 choose the higher F statistic, that is, d ⫽ 4, as we observe in Table 16.4,
indicating rather a slow response. In Table 16.5, we present the F statistics
for the STAR model speciﬁcation. We observe that we accept the hypothesis of Equation (16.9) and reject the hypothesis of Equation (16.10), thus
we choose the ESTAR model.

ESTAR-GARCH (1,1) Estimation
In Table 16.6, the results of the ESTAR model with GARCH (1,1) process
are presented. As initial values for parameters c and γ, we used, respectively,
the sample mean and 1, whose values were found equal with ⫺0.0053 and
4.489, respectively. From the results of Table 16.6, we observe that in the
middle regime of ESTAR without bootstrapping estimation negative average returns are reported on Monday, while the highest positive average
returns are presented on Fridays. All the parameters in the linear middle
regime are statistically signiﬁcant. On the other hand, in the outer regime

with ESTAR estimation, signiﬁcant positive average returns are presented
only on Mondays, while negative returns are reported on Tuesdays. The
returns of the other days of the trading week are statistically insigniﬁcant.
The model corrects for autocorrelation and ARCH effects in all signiﬁcance levels. Based on the F statistic, we reject the null hypothesis that the
regression coefﬁcients are equal.
In bootstrapping ESTAR estimation and the middle regime, we conclude that there is the day-of-the-week effect, while the highest returns
are presented on Fridays and negative returns on Mondays. All the coefﬁcients in the middle regime are statistically significant. In the outer
regime and the bootstrapping regression only, coefﬁcients π21, βMON, and
βWED are signiﬁcant, and we observe that there is a reverse Monday effect,
while the average ret urns on Mondays are positive and the average
returns are negative on Wednesdays. The remaining weekday average
returns are statistically insigniﬁcant. The bootstrapping ESTAR corrects
for both autocorrelation and ARCH effects. According to F statistic, the
null hypothesis of the coefﬁcients equality is rejected. We observe that
based on the information criteria and log-likelihood statistic, ESTAR
outperforms the previous models, except from EGARCH, but the comparison might not be the most appropriate as the formulation of the last
model is different.

Forecasting Results and Performance
In Table 16.7, we report the forecasting performance measures. The mean
absolute error (MAE) is very close and the root mean square error (RMSE)
is identical with all models, except in the ESTAR model, for in-sample
period, which the latter model presents the best performance. In out-ofsample period, RMSE and MAE are lower in GARCH (1,1), followed by
OLS, and then by EGARCH (1,1). ESTAR-GARCH (1,1) presents lower
RMSE and MAE and so better forecasts performance. In the percentage of
the correct signal criteria, OLS and EGARCH (1,1) model outperform
GARCH (1,1), where the ﬁrst two models capture the correct signal at
56.7 percent (34 of 60) trading days, while GARCH (1,1) captures correctly at 55.0 percent (33 of 60) trading days. ESTAR-GARCH (1,1) outperforms all models, capturing the correct signal in 38 of 60 trading days
or a percentage order of 63.4 percent. Speciﬁcally in the short horizon of
10 ahead periods, ESTAR-GARCH (1,1) predicts correctly at 70 percent,
while OLS predicts correctly at 60 percent and GARCH models capture
the correct signal only at 30 percent. In particular, many investors and traders are interested in the forecasting of the correct signal over a ﬁve-day
trading week. For this purpose, ESTAR-GARCH model outperforms signiﬁcantly the simple GARCH models.

CONCLUSION
In this chapter we examine the day-of-the-week effect on the S&P 500
index. We ﬁnd that this calendar anomaly exists according to all estimations, except in ESTAR-GARCH (1,1), where the Monday effect exists in

249

250

Pa rt i I I E X C H A NG E - T R A DED F UND ST R ATE G I ES

the linear middle regime and the reverse Monday effect is reported in the
nonlinear outer regime. We propose the STAR models for the day-of-theweek effect; however, this is only a proposed model, which was examined
for only one calendar anomaly and using only one index, while further
research can be applied in other calendar effects. Furthermore, the forecasting performance of ESTAR model outperforms the forecasting ability
of the other estimated models, especially regarding the correct signal,
which is the most important and realistic tool in real-world trading environments.

Disparity of USD
Interbank Interest
Rates in Hong Kong
and Singapore
Is There Any Arbitrage Opportunity?
Michael C. S. Wongand Wilson F. Chan

ABSTRACT
This chapter compares USD interest rates in two interbank markets,
namely, Hong Kong Interbank Best Offer Rate (HIBOR) and Singapore
Interbank Best Offer Rate (SIBOR). Both Hong Kong and Singapore are
global currency trading centers located in the same time zone, in which
there are many global banks, fund houses, and hedge funds. However, we
ﬁnd a consistent disparity between HIBOR and SIBOR in 2008, which
even reaches 90 basis points after June 2008. This obviously contradicts the
well-known efﬁcient market hypothesis. This chapter attempts to explain
why bank dealers would be reluctant to do arbitrage.

INTRODUCTION
USD is an international currency for international transactions. Many
international activities on lending and borrowing are based on USD, undergone in New York, London, Zurich, Singapore, Hong Kong, or Tokyo. The
255

256

Part iV FOR EIGN EXCHA NGE MARKETS, ALGOR ITHMIC TR ADING, A ND R ISK

interbank markets for USD funds should be very efﬁcient because of the
presence of dealers from global banks. Disparity in the USD interest rate
in these markets should be extremely narrow and directionless, especially
when the markets operate in the same time zone. This chapter compares
the USD interbank ﬁxing rate in Hong Kong and Singapore, denoted by
HIBOR and SIBOR. We ﬁnd that HIBOR is consistently higher than
SIBOR in 2008. The disparity becomes much wider after June 2008 and
reaches to 80 basis points. This seems to be inconsistent with the wellknown efﬁcient market hypothesis (EMH) and to provide traders arbitrage
opportunities.
Previous studies on interest rate and interest spreads document that
credit risk, liquidity risk, and tax can affect interest rate (see, for instance,
Elton et al. 2001; Eom Helwege, and Uno, 2003; and Longstaff, 2004).
These studies focus mainly on the corporate bond market in the United
States. Few studies explore the interest spreads in the interbank money
market. It is generally assumed that borrowers in interbank markets are
credible participants, spreads in interbank markets could be negligible, and
traders do not have any arbitrage opportunit y. However, our evidence
shows a contradictory picture.
This chapter will proceed as follows: the second section of this chapter
introduces the HIBOR and SIBOR markets. This chapter’s third section
describes our data and ﬁndings. The fourth section of this chapter provides
explanations on the disparity between HIBOR and SIBOR, and the ﬁfth
section concludes the chapter.

HIBOR AND SIBOR
Interbank markets are very active in major international banking centers,
such as New York, London, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Bank dealers bring
global supply and demand to these markets in order to exchange for funds.
They may also actively look for arbitrage opportunities. It would be very
hard to ﬁnd any evidence of market inefﬁciency in interbank markets for
those actively traded products.
A USD fund is an actively traded product in interbank markets of different regions. Interest rate calculation for ﬂoating rate assets and liabilities
denominated in USD are mostly based on USD interbank rate plus a
spread. Outside the United States, the interbank USD interest rate generally refers to London Interbank Bank Offer Rate (LIBOR), Singapore

c h a p t e r 1 7 DIS PA R I T Y OF U S D IN TER BA N K IN TER EST R ATES

Interbank Offer Rate (SIBOR), and Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate
(HIBOR), respectively. Interbank dealers will collectively ﬁx the interest
rate in both the AM and PM. These are so-called AM and PM ﬁxings. AM
ﬁxing is commonly used as a basis for interest rate calculation. In New York
there is no New York interbank offer rate, although New York is an active
money market. Both LIBOR and SIBOR have had a long history in the
market. The Hong Kong banking community formally launched the USD
ﬁxing rate on December 18, 2006. This is also the start of the sample
period of this study.

DATA AND FINDINGS
This chapter selects 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month USD interest rates
in the period between December 18, 2006 and November 28, 2008 for
analysis. The interest rates are interbank ﬁxing rates (AM) in Hong Kong
and Singapore (i.e., HIBOR and SIBOR). Figure 17.1 shows 3-month
HIBOR and SIBOR in the sample period. The two USD interest rates
move closely and HIBOR tends to move higher than SIBOR in 2008.
Figures 17.2 to 17.4 show the disparity between HIBOR and SIBOR for

1-month, 3-month, and 6-month tenors, respectively. In Figure 17.2,
1-month HIBOR is consistently higher than 1-month SIBOR in 2008.
The average difference is around 15 basis points in the period between
January 2008 and June 2008. The difference ﬁnally reaches 80 basis points
in September and October of 2008. A similar phenomenon also happens to
3-month and 6-month HIBOR and SIBOR.

EXPLANATIONS FOR THE
HIBOR-SIBOR DISPARITY
According to logic of EMH, the disparity between HIBOR and SIBOR
should be corrected quickly because both markets are trading the same
product and in the same time zone. One important assumption of EMH is
the presence of professional traders who are able to do arbitrage. Their collective efforts should effectively correct any mispricing. In the interbank
money market, bank dealers take the role of the “professional traders” and
are assumed to actively look for arbitrage opportunities. In practices, bank
dealers have some constraints in their arbitrage decisions, including:
• Capital requirement: Basel II, the global banking regulation,
requires capital requirements on credit exposures to other banks.

259

260

Part iV FOR EIGN EXCHA NGE MARKETS, ALGOR ITHMIC TR ADING, A ND R ISK

Many banks have internal guidelines that bank dealers are not allowed
to take unnecessary funds and credit positions. This restricts bank
dealers from taking the beneﬁt of arbitrage. Nonbank institutions do
not have such constraints, but they cannot easily access the HIBOR
and SIBOR markets. If they want to make gains from arbitrage
between HIBOR and SIBOR, they will require a wider gap between
HIBOR and SIBOR to compensate their transactions costs paid to
bank dealers.
• Counterparty risk: In 2008, counterparty risk was a big issue in
interbank transactions. The ﬁnancial troubles of Bear Stearns in
March 2008 triggered off concerns over the ﬁnancial soundness of
global institutions. Bank dealers became more sensitive to credit
quality in lending via the interbank markets. The ﬁnancial crisis that
happened in July to October in 2008 made bank dealers to be
extremely cautious in allocating their credit exposures. The higher
HIBOR against SIBOR might indicate higher credit risk involved in
the Hong Kong interbank market. This can be true as there is higher
number of small-sized banks in Hong Kong than in Singapore.
• Liquidity risk: In 2008 liquidity was a big issue for many banks.
Financial markets became volatile and marketable assets suddenly
turned to be less marketable. To assure liquidity, banks would prefer
loans of much shorter maturity, such as overnight loans. This
weakened the incentives of bank dealers to do arbitrage in the
1-month, 3-month, and 6-month interbank market.

CONCLUSION
The previous ﬁnding shows evidence of disparity between HIBOR and
SIBOR, which are USD interbank ﬁxing rates in Hong Kong and Singapore,
respectively. The disparity stays at around 15 basis points in the ﬁrst-half of
2008 and even reaches 90 basis points in the crisis period of 2008. Even
though the disparity provided bank dealers arbitrage opportunities, they
might find hard it to do arbitrage because of consideration on capital
requirements, counterparty risk, and liquidity risk. Efﬁcient market hypothesis might have overstated the power of professional traders. In volatile
market environments, arbitrage opportunities may exist but professional
traders could become reluctant to arbitrage.

Jack Penm and R. D. Terrell

ABSTRACT
We have undertaken this research in forex trade assessment and investment
decisions under climate change, using new and important zero-non-zero
patterned time-series approaches. Our results indicate that Granger feedback relations exist in the system, involving exchange rates and price
indexes. This is valuable not only in predicting price changes but also in
capturing forex trading opportunities.

INTRODUCTION
Powerful computing equipment has had a dramatic impact on forex modeling and simulations, and has motivated development of innovative computing-intensive time-series approaches to forex trade assessment for capturing
trading opportunities. New zero-non-zero (ZNZ) patterned time-series
methodology has speciﬁed models in a more sophisticated manner. This has

263

264

Part iV FOR EIGN EXCHA NGE MARKETS, ALGOR ITHMIC TR ADING, A ND R ISK

enabled the use of data in highly adaptive ways and facilitated major innovations in development of management and evaluation of forex modeling and
trading strategy. Against that background, we undertake research in forex
movement modeling and data analysis using new and important patterned
time-series approaches. While trade and environmental investment decisions still have to operate in an uncertain market, and human judgment can
never be fully replaced, quantitative time-series analysis has an important
role to play in guiding effective trade decisions and setting trade strategy.
This chapter investigates a very important issue, namely, causal links
between exchange rates and price indexes, and undertakes an assessment of
the causal positioning of the signiﬁcant relevant economic variables involved
in the interactions. Perhaps the simplest of many contending hypotheses is
that there is a short-term causal link, in which international capital ﬂows
lead movements in the exchange rate. The absence of stable long-term relationships would indicate that, over a long period, the levels of exchange
rates are less dependent on the levels of prices. If stable long-term relationships exist among exchange rates and price indexes, then, after temporary
deviations in the short term, the levels of exchange rates would revert to
their traditional long-term relationships with price indexes. Identiﬁcation of
such long-term relationships, if they exist, would be essential in forecasting
exchange rate movements, which affects buying and selling trade behavior
and thereby identiﬁes future trading opportunities.
We test this hypothesis using recent developments in cointegration theory. The tests are undertaken within the framework of ZNZ patterned
vector error-correction modeling (V ECM) and associated cointegrating
vectors, with allowance for possible zero entries proposed in Penm and
Terrell (2003). This approach is particularly useful for analyzing cointegrating relationships between prices and exchange rates in forex trade
markets. Its special attraction is that, by permitting zero coefﬁcients in the
V ECM, it allows for a highly insightful economic interpretation of the
cointegrating relationships and their re-adjustment following deviations
from equilibrium. New error-correction technologies for linear and
nonlinear modeling are helpful in explaining and interpreting certain
aspects of causal links between prices and exchange rates. The patterned
cointegrating vectors in the VECM are valuable not only in taking trading
opportunities but also in forecasting price changes.
There are also several other issues that must be addressed before we set
out the full complexity of the pattern of linkages we are to investigate.

The relevant price variables may differ from country to country and at different points in the sequence of events. We therefore examine consumer
prices, wholesale prices, and export and import prices, in order to fully
understand the strength and direction of certain causal links. We also consider whether such links are short term or long term in nature and whether
it is possible in a complex sequential process to detect feedback loops. We
construct a system model to investigate the following two causal chains.

prices: m.p.  import prices: pdy  productivity changes.

We also propose to include a forgetting factor in the estimation of the
patterned V ECMs. The forgetting factor technique is a data-weighting
process that allows the estimation to place greater weight on more recent
observations and less weight on earlier data. In such estimation, the effects
on the underlying relationships of evolution generated by the causal linkage
process will be accounted for.
As to why a subset time-series model is used, subset modeling includes
full-order models, and researchers use this approach whenever measurements exhibit some periodicity. If the underlying true time-series process
has a subset structure, the suboptimal full-order speciﬁcation can give
rise to inefﬁcient estimates and inferior projections. Our forgetting factor
approaches improve estimated parameter proﬁle, model structure, and
performance reliabilit y for assessing complex relationships involving

265

266

Part iV FOR EIGN EXCHA NGE MARKETS, ALGOR ITHMIC TR ADING, A ND R ISK

slowly evolving long-term effects, such as climate change. These qualities
are not found in conventional time-series approaches involving only fullorder models. Subset modeling is superior to full-order modeling for discovering complex relationships, as has been clearly indicated in Penm and
Terrell (2003).
In order to illustrate the practical use of the proposed forex modeling
and trade forecast approach, we investigate the causal relationships among
exchange rates, price indexes, other macroeconomic variables, and the
exchange rate forecasting in Taiwan using the monthly data over the period
1982 to 2008. Researchers have recognized the potential hazards that climate change and environmental change may present for small island developing states such as Taiwan. Changes are expected to be negatively
impacted, and thus directly threaten the Taiwanese population. Those
changes include: a general rise in surface temperature and in sea level;
changes in seasonal temperature variation and rainfall patterns; variations in
soil moisture and water resources; and increases in the incidence of severe
weather events such as typhoons and ﬂoods.
Climate change in Taiwan has both environmental and socioeconomic
outcomes for agriculture: changes in the availability and quality of land,
soil, and water resources, for example, may later be reﬂected in poorer crop
performance, which causes prices to rise. Climate-related changes in agricult ural conditions will likely only increase Taiwan’s dependence on
imported food. The price indexes track changes in the prices consumers
pay for products and services. Those price indexes will therefore track
changes over time in the long-term effects of climate changes and their
impacts on the production, use, and disposal of items purchased each year
by consumers.
This chapter is organized as follows: the second section of this chapter
outlines the construction of patterned vector error-correction modeling,
which demonstrates the “presence and absence” restrictions on the coefﬁcients of subset time-series systems, including full-order systems. Also, brief
descriptions are given of the forgetting factor techniques used for estimation. In this chapter’s third section we assess the causal link between
exchange rates and price indexes in Taiwan. We also present the forex
forecasting results indicating signiﬁcant movements in exchange rates, in
which the MAE criterion is used to examine prediction performance. A brief
summary is provided in the ﬁnal section of this chapter.

METHODOLOGY
The Forgetting Factor
The use of forgetting factor in time-series analysis has attracted considerable interest in recent years. For example, Penm and Terrell (2003) utilize a
forgetting factor in subset autoregressive modeling of the spot aluminum
and nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange. The use of the forgetting
factor technique to estimation and simulation of ﬁnancial market variables
has been reported by Brailsford, Penm, and Terrell (2002).
Consider a vector autoregression (VAR) model of the following form:
q

y( t ) + ∑ Bτ y( t − τ ) = ε ( t )

(18.1)

τ =1

y(t) is a sx1 vector of wide-sense stationary series. ε(t) is a sx1 vector of
independent and identically distributed random process with E{ε(t)}  0 and
E{ε(t)ε′(t  τ)}  V if τ  0 and 0 if τ  0. Bτ, τ  1, …, q are sxs matrices
of coefﬁcients. The observations y(t) {t  1, … , T } are available.
Let λ(t)  [λ1(t) … … λn (t)] denotes a 1xs vector associated with time t.
Following O’Neill, Penm, and Penm (2007), a strategy for determining the
value of the forgetting factor λ(t) is as follows:

λi ( t ) = λ η−t +1 if 1 ≤ t ≤ η and = 1 if η < t ≤ T for i = 1, … n

(18.2)

Equation (18.2) means that “forgetting” of the past occurs from time η.
No forgetting is involved from time η  1 to time T. If λ  1 for every t,
then we obtain the ordinary least squares solution. If 0  λ  1, the past is
weighted down geometrically from time η. In theory, the value of λ could
be different between λi(t) (a so-called variable forgetting factor). For simplicity, we only consider the ﬁxed forgetting factor case in which the value
of λ is constant for λi(t).
This means that the coefﬁcients in Equation (18.1) are estimated to
minimize

One important issue relating to the use of the forgetting factor in estimation is how to determine the value of λ in applications. The conventional
method is based on arbitrary or personal choices. Penm and Terrell (2003)
propose to determine the value of λ using bootstrapping. In this study, their
recommended method is adopted for the determination of the value
of λ. While Brailsford, Penm, and Terrell (2002) also propose a procedure to
determine the value of dynamic forgetting factor for nonstationary systems,
we have focused on the use of a ﬁxed forgetting factor in this study, because
applications of a ﬁxed forgetting factor to forex market movements is likely to
be more predictable.

VECM Modeling for an I(1) System
In constructing V ECM modeling for an I(1) system, from Equation
q
(18.1) we have Bq(L)  I  Σ Bτ Lτ, where L denotes the lag operator, and
τ1
Ly(t)  y(t1). It is assumed that the roots of |Bq(L)|  0 lie outside or
on the unit circle to ensure that y(t) can contain I(1) variables.
Of note, y(t) is integrated of order d, I(d), if it contains at least one
element which must be differenced d times before it becomes I(0). Further,
y(t) is cointegrated with the cointegrating vector, β, of order g, if β’y(t)
is integrated of order (d – g), where y(t) has to contain at least two I(d)
variables.
Following Penm and Terrell (2003), the equivalent VECM for Equation
(18.1) can then be expressed as
B q(1) y(t  1)  B q–1 (L) y (t)  ε(t)

(18.4)

where y(t) contains variables of the types I(0) and I(1). Note that  (IL),
y(t)  y(t) y(t 1) and ε(t) is stationary. Equation (18.4) can be rewritten as
B*y(t  1)  B q1(L) y(t)  ε(t),

(18.5)

where B*  B q (1) and B*y(t  1) is stationary and the ﬁrst term in Equation
(18.5) is the error-correction term. The term B q–1 (L) y (t) is the vector
autoregressive part of the VECM.

c h a p t e r 1 8 F OR EX T R A DING OP P ORT UN I TI ES U n de r C l i m at e C h a n g e

Because y(t) is cointegrated of order 1, the long-term impact matrix, B*,
must be singular. As a result, B*  αβ′ and β′y(t  1) is stationary, where
the rank of B* is r (0  r  s), and α and β are matrices of dimensions s  r
and r  2s respectively. The columns of β are the cointegrating vectors and
the rows of are the loading vectors.
A search algorithm proposed by Penm and Terrell (2003) to select the
optimal ZNZ patterned α and β is described in the following:
1. To begin this algorithm we ﬁrst identify the optimal ZNZ–patterned
VECM, using model selection criteria.
2. After the optimal ZNZ–patterned VECM is identiﬁed, the rank of
the long-term impact matrix is then computed using the singular
value decomposition method so the number of cointegrating vectors
in the system will be known.
3. A tree-pruning algorithm which avoids evaluating all candidates is
then implemented for the search of all acceptable ZNZ patterns of
the loading and cointegrating vectors.
4. The identiﬁed candidates of the ZNZ–patterned cointegrating
vectors are estimated by the method based on a triangular ECM
representation proposed in Penm and Terrell (2003).
5. The estimation of the associated candidates for the ZNZ–patterned
loading vectors is carried out by the regression method with linear
restrictions.
6. The optimal ZNZ patterned α and β are ﬁnally selected by model
selection criteria.
Model development is more convenient using VECMs, rather than the
equivalent VARs, if the systems under study include integrated time-series.
Penm and Terrell (2003) note that, for I(1) systems, the VARs in ﬁrst difference will be misspeciﬁed and the VARs in levels will ignore important
constraints on the coefﬁcient matrices. Although these constraints may be
satisﬁed asymptotically, efﬁciency gains and improvements in forecasts are
likely to result by imposing them. The analogous conclusion applies to I(1)
systems, such as those typically encountered in tests of purchasing power
parity. Comparisons of forecasting performance of the V ECMs versus
VARs for cointegrated systems have been reported in studies such as Penm

269

270

Part iV FOR EIGN EXCHA NGE MARKETS, ALGOR ITHMIC TR ADING, A ND R ISK

and Terrell (2003). The results of these studies indicate that, while in the
short run there may be gains in using unrestricted VAR models, the
VECMs produce long-run forecasts with smaller errors when the variables
used in the models satisfy the test for cointegration.
Further to these developments, we consider a hypothesis where every
(i,j)-th element, for speciﬁed i and j, is zero in all coefﬁcient matrices in a
VAR. If this hypothesis is framed in the VAR expressed by Equation (18.1),
these zero entries will also hold in the error-correction terms and in the
vector autoregressive part of the equivalent VECM, say Equation (18.4). A
discussion of this property is provided by Penm and Terrell (2003). Analogously, we can achieve a result that if all (i,j)-th coefﬁcient elements in the
error-correction terms and all (i, j)-th coefﬁcient elements in the vector
autoregressive part of the VECM are zeros, then every (i,j)-th entry is zero
for all coefﬁcient matrices in a VAR. The implications of the above outcome
are straightforward. If yj does not Granger-cause yi, then any (i, j)-th entry
must be zero for all coefﬁcient matrices in the VAR. Also all (i, j)-th coefﬁcient elements in the equivalent VECM are zeros.
In a similar way, we can demonstrate that if yj does Granger-cause yi , then
the (i,j)-th element of Bq(L) in (1) is nonzero. Also, at least a single (i,j)-the
coefﬁcient element is nonzero in Bq(1) or Bq–1(L) in the equivalent VECM.
Of note, an indirect causality from yj to yi through ym indicates yj causing yi
but only through ym. Hence, yj Granger-causes ym , ym Granger-causes yi, and
yj does not Granger-cause yi directly. We can easily demonstrate that the
VAR in (18.2) has nonzero (m,j )-th and (i, m)-th elements and a zero (i, j)-th
element in Bq(L). This indirect causality can also be shown in the equivalent
VECM, which has at least a single nonzero (m,j)-th element and a single
nonzero (i,m)-th elements in Bq(1) and Bq–1(L). Also all the (i, j)-th elements
in the equivalent VECM are zeros.
The previous discussion indicates that Granger causality, Granger noncausality, and indirect causality detected from both the ZNZ–patterned
VECM and its equivalent ZNZ–patterned VAR are identical. Since the use
of the VECM is more convenient, it is obvious the ZNZ–patterned VECM
is a more straightforward and effective means of testing for the Grangercausal relations. The same beneﬁts will be present if the ZNZ–patterned
VECM is used to analyze cointegrating relations.
Cointegration theory is associated with “error-correction” and has important implications for forecasting. If cointegration is found to exist among certain variables, then such long-term relationships should be explicitly identiﬁed

c h a p t e r 1 8 F OR EX T R A DING OP P ORT UN I TI ES U n de r C l i m at e C h a n g e

when forecasting, which is very important in capturing trading opportunity
and setting trading strategies. Recent empirical studies have demonstrated
that imposing such restrictions in forecasting would signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the
forecasts, especially in the longer term. Further, the development course of
the climate change is a long-term slowly evolving underlying process, and
the effects of climate change will be exhibited in the long-term patterned
cointegrating relations, which are detected in the error-correction term of
the patterned VECM.

DATA AND EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
In this study, monthly observations of economic price indexes and exchange
rate variables over the period January 1982 to June 2008 are used (T  306).
These data are obtained from the Taiwanese Economic Database. The year
2000 is selected as the base year for all indexes involved. Table 18.1 presents
those variables which are examined contemporaneously in a stochastic vector
system.
All variables, excluding BOPCF, are log transformed such that y1(t) 
log(E), y 2(t)  BOPCF, y 3(t)  log(UCP), y 4(t)  log(UWP), y 5(t) 
log(UMP), y6(t)  log(UXP), y7(t)  log(UM2), y8(t)  log(UEA), and y9(t)
 log(UPDY), Unit root tests indicate that all transformed series are I(1).
Following Brailsford, Penm, and Terrell (2002), we apply a ﬁxed forgetting
factor with the value 0.99 to the stochastic system involved. We then conduct the search procedures proposed in Penm and Terrell (2003) to obtain
the optimal ZNZ–patterned VECM model over the period January 1982 to
March 2007 (T  291).

In the course of selecting the optimal lag order (p) for the autoregressive part of the VECM system, we adopt the principle used by Penm and
Terrell (2003) to enhance the procedure. That is, we examine whiteness for
the residual vectors from the V ECM chosen by the Akaike information
criterion. If the residual vector process proves to be nonwhite, we sequentially increase q to q  1, and check the resultant residual vector process
until the process is a vector white noise process. An optimal value of 5 has
been identiﬁed for q, as the resultant residual vector process for q  5
becomes a white noise process. The optimal ZNZ–patterned VECM with
the lags 1, 3, and 5 for the autoregressive part, and the optimal and are
then selected by using the modiﬁed Hannan-Quinn criterion (MHQC).
Subsequently, we will use MHQC as an abbreviation for the modiﬁed criterion, which is deﬁned by MHQC  log |V̂|  [2 log log f(T)/f(T)]N,
where f(T)  Σ λ T-t is the effective sample size, N is the number of functionally independent parameters, and V̂ is the sample estimate of V.
Following the procedure for examining causality in Penm and Terrell
(2003), the selected V ECM supports the two Granger causality chains
which are shown below in Figure 18.1.

We then utilize the model speciﬁcation selection approach to select the
optimal patterned VECM models at T  292, 293, and 294. An identical

CONCLUSION
The chapter presents the causal links between exchange rates and macroeconomic price indexes, supported by patterned VECM modeling and simulations with the forgetting factor in a relevant and complex forex trade
environment.
This approach can be used to guide further appropriate use of data in monitoring changes in forex trade environments. Methodologies and technologies
currently used to analyze exchange rate, banking, and policy studies will have
access to a more rigorous academic methodology for handling databases built
up over periods of considerable structural change, resulting in improved and
more timely responses in their ﬁelds.
As the development course of climate change is a long-term, slowly evolving, underlying process, the trading effects of climate change are exhibited
in the long-term patterned cointegrating relations, which are detected in the
error-correction term of the patterned VECM.

The Impact of
Algorithmic
Trading Models
on the Stock
Market
Ohaness G. Paskelian

ABSTRACT
The manner in which electronic trading is conducted on international ﬁnancial markets has dramatically changed in recent decades as more and more
stages of the trading process have been radically altered by electronic means.
One of the most recent developments is algorithmic trading which primarily
focuses on the minimization of implicit transaction costs in order execution.
Algorithmic trading models typically strive toward achieving or beating a
speciﬁed benchmark with their executions. An algorithmic trading model
can be distinguished by its underlying benchmark, trading style, or aggressiveness (Kissell and Malamut, 2006). The existing literature addressing the
concept of algorithmic trading focuses on the investors’ perspective. This
research investigates algorithmic trading from a market perspective and its

275

Part iV FOR EIGN EXCHA NGE MARKETS, ALGOR ITHMIC TR ADING, A ND R ISK

impact on the market outcome. It emphasizes how the algorithmic trading
systems can provide better trade execution and lower market volatility when
compared with traditional trading techniques.

INTRODUCTION
During the last decade, automation and new technologies have changed the
landscape of traditional trading systems. Algorithmic trading is one of the
most widely used computerized automated systems and is very popular
among traders and investors. The basic concept of algorithmic trading is to
slice an order in such a manner that its impact on the market will be minimal.
Using mathematical models and real-time market data, algorithms can determine both the optimum size of the order and its time of submission to the
market. This minimizes the impact of the order on the market. The volume
of trades using algorithmic trading models has been steadily increasing over
the past few years. In 2008 more than 40 percent of the transactions carried
on Deutsche Börse’s Xetra trading system were performed using algorithmic
trading systems. According to Greenwich Associates, “the proportion of
US equity trading volume executed electronically increased to 36 per cent
in 2008–2009 from 32 per cent in 2007–2008—a shift attributable in large
part to the pick-up in algorithmic trading.” (Greenwich Associates, 2009).
Greenwich Associates report that more than three-quarters of all U.S. institutions and 95 percent of the largest and most active institutional traders use
algorithmic trading strategies. This accounts for approximately 18 percent of
overall U.S. equity trading volume.
In the ﬁnancial markets, orders forwarded to brokers-dealers can be
either discretionary or nondiscretionary. Nondiscretionary orders are to
be executed immediately in a given market. Discretionary orders allow the
broker-dealer to decide on the quantities, timing, and method of execution. Algorithmic trading systems are computerized models dealing with
nondiscretionary orders without intervention from a human broker-dealer.
Algorithms are designed to work discretionary orders within the realities
of the market microstructure for securities (Baker and Tiwari, 2004).
Algorithmic trading systems are particularly well suited for highly liquid
securities traded on electronic limit order books. Since trading volume and
price-spread vary continuously over time, algorithms can be designed to
track a particular price or volume. Thus, a trading order can be executed

c h a p t e r 1 9 THE IM PAC T OF A LG OR I TH M IC T R A DING MO DE LS

only within parameters speciﬁed by the algorithm to minimize its impact
on the overall market.
In this chapter, we present an overview of the impact of algorithmic
trading systems on market price, liquidity, and movement. We also provide
a description of the major strategies used in algorithmic trading systems.
We conclude with a note on some future developments in this area.

THE IMPACT OF ALGORITHMIC
TRADING ON THE MARKET
Algorithmic trading research is in its beginning stage. The following is a
summary of the more prominent articles on this subject. Almgren and
Lorenz (2007) provide an overview of the evolution of algorithmic trading systems over time. The ﬁrst generation of algorithmic strategies aims
to meet benchmarks generated by the market itself. The benchmarks are
largely independent from the actual securities order. Examples of this
strategy are the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) or an average of
daily open-high-low-close (OHLC) prices. The second generation of
algorithmic trading strategies aims to meet order-centric benchmarks
generated at the time of order submission to the algorithm. The execution
strategy targets the minimization of the implementation shortfall, i.e., the
difference between decision price and ﬁnal execution price. Second-generation algorithms implement static execution strategies, which predetermine (before the start of the actual order execution) how to handle the
trade-off between minimizing market impact costs (by trading slowly)
and minimizing the variance of the execution price (by trading immediately) (Gsell, 2007). Third-generation algorithms implement dynamic
execution strategies which reevaluate strategy at each single decision time.
This enables the model to respond to market developments dynamically.
Trading aggressiveness can be altered during the course of the decision
making process (Almgren and Lorenz, 2007).
Yang and Jiu (2006) propose a framework to help investors to choose the
most suitable algorithm. Morris and Kantor-Hendrick (2005) note some
factors that investors take into consideration when deciding to use an algorithmic trading system. Trading style and frequency, regulatory obligations,
and trader experience were found to be signiﬁcant variables when selecting
an algorithmic trading system.

The literature provides studies covering the impact of algorithmic trading models on different markets. Konishi (2002) proposes an optimal slicing
strategy for VWAP trades. Domowitz and Yegerman (2005) examine the
execution quality of algorithms in comparison with brokers’ traditional
method of handling large orders. They conclude that VWAP algorithms on
average have an underperformance of 2 bps. This is counterbalanced by the
fact that algorithms can be offered at lower fees than human order handling. Kissel (2007) outlines statistical methods to compare the performance of algorithmic trading solutions. Hendershott, Jones, and Menkveld
(2007) present evidence that algorithmic trading and liquidity are positively
related.
Chaboud et al. (2009) study the effects of algorithmic trading on the
foreign exchange (FX) markets using three widely traded currency pairs.
They ﬁnd that algorithmic trading systems are not related to volatility and
that the variance in FX returns is not related to algorithmic trading order
ﬂow. The authors suggest that there is a relationship between trade-correlated and trade-uncorrelated information processing patterns when comparing algorithmic trading systems and human traders. They conclude that
algorithmic trading systems provide better quotes due to their ability to
process more public information than a human trader.
Hendershott and Riordan (2009) provide a continuation of the previous
study of Chaboud et al. (2009). They test the average level of algorithmic
trading and human information (measured as the variance of the randomwalk component of returns) and conclude that algorithmic trading orders
and quotes are more informative than are those made by humans. Riordan
and Storkenmaier (2009) study the impact of the upgrade of Deutsche
Börse electronic trading system on the information content of algorithmic
trading systems. They ﬁnd that the upgrade of the trading system has
decreased trading costs and increased overall liquidity. Further, traders
using algorithmic trading systems process information much faster than
their human counterparts and thus increase the liquidity of the market and
the information content of the prices.
Finally, Gsell (2007) provides a simulation result of the implementation
of algorithmic trading systems. He ﬁnds that algorithmic trading systems
have an impact on market outcome in terms of market prices and market
volatility. He also ﬁnds that the low latency of the algorithmic systems has
the potential to signiﬁcantly lower market volatility. However, when he

c h a p t e r 1 9 THE IM PAC T OF A LG OR I TH M IC T R A DING MO DE LS

simulated trading with larger volumes, the algorithmic trading system
resulted in negative market prices.

ALGORITHMIC STRATEGIES
One of the ﬁrst algorithmic trading strategies consisted of using a volumeweighted average price, as the price at which orders would be executed. The
VWAP introduced by Berkowitz et al. (1988) can be calculated as the dollar
amount traded for every transaction (price times shares traded) divided by
the total shares traded for a given period. If the price of a buy order is
lower than the VWAP, the trade is executed; if the price is higher, then the
trade is not executed. Participants wishing to lower the market impact of
their trades stress the importance of market volume. Market volume impact
can be measured through comparing the execution price of an order to a
benchmark. The VWAP benchmark is the sum of every transaction price
paid, weighted by its volume. VWAP strategies allow the order to dilute the
impact of orders through the day. Most institutional trading occurs in ﬁlling orders that exceed the daily volume. When large numbers of shares
must be traded, liquidity concerns can affect price goals. For this reason,
some firms offer multiday VWAP strategies to respond to customers’
requests. In order to further reduce the market impact of large orders, customers can specify their own volume participation by limiting the volume
of their orders to coincide with low expected volume days. Each order is
sliced into several days’ orders and then sent to a VWAP engine for the
corresponding days. VWAP strategies fall into three categories: sell order
to a broker-dealer who guarantees VWAP; cross the order at a future date
at VWAP; or trade the order with the goal of achieving a price of VWAP
or better (Madhavan, 2000).
The second algorithmic trading strategy is the time-weighted average
price (TWAP). TWAP allows traders to slice a trade over a certain period
of time, thus an order can be cut into several equal parts and be traded
throughout the time period speciﬁed by the order. TWAP is used for
orders which are not dependent on volume. TWAP can overcome obstacles
such as fulﬁlling orders in illiquid stocks with unpredictable volume. Conversely, high-volume traders can also use TWAP to execute their orders
over a speciﬁc time by slicing the order into several parts so that the impact
of the execution does not signiﬁcantly distort the market.

279

Another t ype of algorithmic trading strategy is the implementation
shortfall or the arrival price. The implementation shortfall is deﬁned as
the difference in return between a theoretical portfolio and an implemented portfolio. When deciding to buy or sell stocks during portfolio
construction, a portfolio manager looks at the prevailing prices (decision
prices). However, several factors can cause execution prices to be different
from decision prices. This results in returns that differ from the portfolio
manager’s expectations (Perold, 1988). Implementation shortfall is measured as the difference between the dollar return of a paper portfolio
(paper return) where all shares are assumed to transact at the prevailing
market prices at the time of the investment decision and the actual dollar
return of the portfolio (real portfolio return). The main advantage of the
implementation shortfall-based algorithmic system is to manage transactions costs (most notably market impact and timing risk) over the speciﬁed trading horizon while adapting to changing market conditions and
prices (Kissell and Malamut, 2006).
The participation algorithm or volume participation algorithm is used to
trade up to the order quantity using a rate of execution that is in proportion
to the actual volume trading in the market. It is ideal for trading large
orders in liquid instruments where controlling market impact is a priority.
The participation algorithm is similar to the VWAP except that a trader
can set the volume to a constant percentage of total volume of a given
order. This algorithm can represent a method of minimizing supply and
demand imbalances (Kim, 2007).
Smart order routing (SOR) algorithms allow a single order to exist simultaneously in multiple markets. They are critical for algorithmic execution models. It is highly desirable for algorithmic systems to have the ability to connect
different markets in a manner that permits trades to ﬂow quickly and efﬁciently from market to market. Smart routing algorithms provide full integration of information among all the participants in the different markets where
the trades are routed. SOR algorithms are critical to the smooth operation
of the highly fragmented U.S. market structure. In the United States alone,
there are more than 100 trading venues on different electronic communications networks (ECNs). Thus, SOR algorithms allow traders to place large
blocks of shares in the order book without fear of sending out a signal to other
market participants. The algorithm matches limit orders and executes them at
the midpoint of the bid-ask price quoted in different exchanges.

ALGORITHMIC TRADING ADVANTAGES
Algorithmic trading systems provide a number of advantages over traditional methods, including:
1. Increased capacity: Computerized algorithms have much more
powerful computational capabilities to handle computationally
intensive processes.
2. Decreased costs: Commissions for electronic trading tend to be
signiﬁcantly lower than other types of trades.
3. Real-time feedback and control: Algorithmic trading provides better
feedback mechanisms than traditional trading methods. The ability
of the algorithmic models to process new information is found to be
superior to that of the human trader.
4. Anonymity: Algorithmic trading provides privacy and anonymity by
allowing the order originator to remain unknown. Also, since orders
can go through several brokers, the original time of the order can
remain conﬁdential .
5. Control of information leakage: Algorithmic trading protects traders
by preventing them from disseminating their alpha expectations to
other market participants.
6. Access to multiple trading markets: Algorithms decide
instantaneously where to send the orders depending on the best
available market. Thus, orders can be placed on the best available
market crossing networks and internal ﬂow.
7. Consistent execution methodology: Consistent execution was one
of the key factors behind benchmarks such as VWAP. The
knowledge of the algorithm enables the trader to understand how
and why the algorithmic systems reacted to the market in any
given situation.
8. Best execution and transaction-cost-analysis (TCA) real-time: TCA,
including execution, impact, slippage, and correlation information,
can be available instantaneously. Thus, analyzing all types of pre- and
post-trade scenarios can be performed.
9. Minimization of errors: The absence of human operators makes
algorithmic trading systems less prone to errors.

10. Compliance monitoring: Compliance rules including limits,
exposure, and short sales can be validated in real-time, and alerts
can be issued for any potential scenario.

ALGORITHMIC TRADING BEYOND
STOCK MARKETS
Algorithmic trading is also spreading to other asset categories, including
foreign exchange, ﬁxed income, futures, options, and derivatives. This
trend is driven by the desire for competitive advantage combined with
the growing availability of electronic trade execution, third-party trading networks, and robust order management systems. As with the equity
sector, the most liquid instruments are receiving the initial focus while
most others still require traditional trading techniques. The foreignexchange market has long depended on phone brokerage with large banks
and FX dealers. However, FX ECNs are taking the market forward by
providing the services and technology solutions which meet this need for
growth and diversity. This in turn adds liquidity to the market as a wider
range of players is enabled to participate. Active traders have become an
increasingly important part of the global FX market in recent years.
They have begun to treat FX as an asset class in its own right. Active
traders have found they can successfully employ the same algorithmic
trading methods in FX to generate alpha as they have previously applied
to equity markets.
Slowly, these different trading venues are opening up and electronic
trading can be executed in limited form. Like the futures market, which has
both electronically traded and pit-traded contracts, the effectiveness of
algorithmic trading will depend on the degree of electronic sophistication
in the market place. The prospect of multi-asset algorithmic trading models
remains quite intriguing.

CONCLUSION
Algorithmic trading systems are designed to lower transaction costs, reduce
market impact, and create liquidity. A large trade executed through an algorithm should be efﬁcient, while creating liquidity and avoiding risk in the

c h a p t e r 1 9 THE IM PAC T OF A LG OR I TH M IC T R A DING MO DE LS

event the market turns in the opposite direction. Another advantage of the
algorithmic trading systems is the splicing and execution of multiple small
orders from a big order, thus minimizing market impact. Simultaneously,
the ability of the algorithmic trading systems to monitor and provide realtime feedback ameliorates the chances of the best execution of these orders.
Moreover, a large order using a number of different algorithms to access
different markets simultaneously can result in faster and quicker execution
of the order.
However, as the market share of algorithmic trading systems increase
with time, the interaction of such systems and consequential side effects
resulting from it should be investigated. As more and more algorithms
are actively trading on securities markets, these algorithms do to some
extent conduct trading with one another, i.e., one algorithmic strategy is
competing with the other instead of trading with a traditional trader.
The changing nature of the trading parties involves policy implications
that algorithmic trading systems providers will soon need to consider
carefully.

Trading in Risk
Dimensions
Lester Ingber

ABSTRACT
Two-shell recursive trading systems were developed in the author’s, mostly
published, previous work. A parameterized trading rule outer-shell uses the
global optimization code adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) to ﬁt the trading system to historical data. A simple ﬁtting algorithm is used for the innershell ﬁt. An additional risk management middle-shell has been added to
create a three-shell recursive optimization/sampling/ﬁtting algorithm. Portfolio-level distributions of copula-transformed multivariate distributions
(with constituent markets possessing different marginal distributions in
returns space) are generated by Monte Carlo samplings. ASA is used to
importance-sampled weightings of these markets. The core code, trading in
risk dimensions (TRD), processes training and testing trading systems on
historical data, and consistently interacts with real-time trading platforms at
minute resolutions, but this scale can be modiﬁed. This approach transforms
constituent probability distributions into a common space where it makes
sense to develop correlations to further develop probability distributions and
risk/uncertainty analyses of the full portfolio. ASA is used for importancesampling these distributions and for optimizing system parameters.

INTRODUCTION
The work presented in this chapter is largely based on my previous work in
several disciplines using a similar formulation of multivariate nonlinear
nonequilibrium systems (Ingber, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c), using powerful
numerical algorithms to ﬁt models to data (Ingber, 2001d).

Adaptive Simulated Annealing
Adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) (Ingber, 1993) is used in trading in risk
dimensions (TRD) to optimize trading-rule parameters and in importancesampled contracts for risk management.
ASA is a C language code developed to statistically ﬁnd the best global ﬁt
of a nonlinear constrained nonconvex cost-function over a D-dimensional
space. This algorithm permits an annealing schedule for “temperature”
T decreasing exponentially in annealing time, k, T  T0 exp(ck1/D). The
introduction of re-annealing also permits adaptation to changing sensitivities in the multidimensional parameter space. This annealing schedule is
faster than fast Cauchy annealing, where T  T0 / k, and much faster than
Boltzmann annealing, where T  T0 /In k. ASA has more than a hundred
options to provide robust tuning over many classes of nonlinear stochastic
systems.

DATA
A time epoch is chosen to measure possible trading intervals, WINDOWe.
Enough price (and volume, etc.) data, e.g., hundreds of epochs, is used
to gather some representative statistics including “outliers.” Deﬁne
dx t =

pt − pt −1
pt −1

(20.1)

Market-differenced variables {dx} lead to portfolio variables dM. Here,
dM signiﬁes the portfolio returns, based on portfolio values {Ki}, e.g.,
dM t =

K t − K t −1
K t −1

(20.2)

EXPONENTIAL MARGINAL
DISTRIBUTION MODELS
This chapter uses exponential distributions to detail TRD algorithms.
However, the TRD code has hooks to work with other distributions.
Assume that each market is ﬁt well to a two-tailed exponential density
distribution p (not to be confused with the indexed price variable pt) with
scale χ and mean m

(20.4)

where χ and m are deﬁned by averages . over a window of data
m = < dx > 2χ 2 =< ( dx )2 > − < dx >2 .

(20.5)

The p(dx) are “marginal” distributions observed in the market, modeled to
ﬁt the above algebraic form. Note that the exponential distribution has an
inﬁnite number of nonzero cumulants, so that  dx2    dx 2 does not
have the same “variance” meaning for this “width” as it does for a Gaussian
distribution, which has only two independent cumulants (and all cumulants
greater than the second vanish). The algorithms in the following section are
speciﬁed to address correlated markets giving rise to the stochastic behavior
of these markets.
Note that to establish the exponential distribution (current time-sensitive
exponential) moving averages are used to force data into a speciﬁc functional
form, a form which must be regularly checked for its statistical signiﬁcance.

COPULA TRANSFORMATION
Aside on Sum of Squared Errors of Gaussian Copula
Gaussian copulas are developed in TRD. Other copula distributions are possible, e.g., student t distributions (often touted as being more sensitive to
fat-tailed distributions—here data is ﬁrst adaptively ﬁt to fat-tailed distributions prior to copula transformations). These alternative distributions can be
quite slow because inverse transformations typically are not as quick as for the
present distribution.

289

290

Part iV FOR EIGN EXCHA NGE MARKETS, ALGOR ITHMIC TR ADING, A ND R ISK

Copulas are cited as an important component of risk management
not yet widely used by risk management practitioners (Blanco, 2005).
Gaussian copulas are presently regarded as the Basel II standard for credit
risk management (Horsewood, 2005). While real-time risk management for
intraday trading is becoming more popular, most approaches still use simpler value-at-risk (VaR) measures (Dionne, Duchesne, and Pacurar, 2006).
TRD permits fast as well as robust copula risk management in real time.
The copula approach can be extended to more general distributions
than those considered here (Ibragimon, 2005). If there are no analytic or
relatively standard math functions for the transformations, then these
transformations must be performed explicitly numerically in code such as
TRD. Then, the ASA_PAR ALLEL OPTIONS already existing in ASA
(developed as part of the 1994 National Science Foundation Parallelizing
ASA and PATHINT Project [PAPP]) would be very useful to speed up
real-time calculations (Ingber, 1993).

Transformation to Gaussian Marginal Distributions
A normal Gaussian distribution has the form

p( dy ) =

2π

(20.6)

with a cumulative distribution
⎛ dy ⎞⎤
1⎡

(20.7)

where the erf( ) function is a tabulated function

erf ( x ) =

2

x

∫ dx e

π 0

' − x' 2

(20.8)

By setting the numerical values of the above two cumulative distributions,
monotonic on interval [0,1], equal to each other, the transformation of the
marginal variables to the y marginal variables is effected

c h a p t e r 2 0 T R A DING IN R IS K DIM ENSIONS

dy = 2erf −1 (2F ( dx ) − 1)

(20.9)

Inverse mapping is used when applying this to the portfolio distribution.
Note that
dy ≥ 0 → dx − m ≥ 0, dy < 0 → dx − m < 0

Including Correlations
To understand how correlations enter, look at the stochastic process deﬁned
by the dyi marginal transformed variables
dy i = gˆ i dwi

(20.12)

where dwi is the Wiener–Gaussian noise contributing to dyi of market i.
The transformations are chosen such that ĝ i  1.
Now, a given market’s noise (ĝi dwi) has potential contributions from all N
markets, which is modeled in terms of N independent Gaussian processes dzk
gˆ i dwi = ∑ gˆ ki dzk

(20.13)

k

The covariance matrix (gij) of these y variables is then given by
g ij = ∑gˆ ki gˆ kj

(20.14)

k

with inverse matrix, the “metric,” written as (gij) and determinant of (gij)
written as g.
Since Gaussian variables are now being used, the covariance matrix is
calculated directly from the transformed data using standard statistics, the

291

292

Part iV FOR EIGN EXCHA NGE MARKETS, ALGOR ITHMIC TR ADING, A ND R ISK

point of this copula transformation (Malevergne and Sornette, 2002;
Rosenberg and Schuermann, 2004).
Correlations ρ ij are derived from bilinear combinations of market volatilities

ρ ij =

g ij

(20.15)

g ii g jj

Since the transformation to Gaussian space has deﬁned gii  1, here the
covariance matrices theoretically are identical to the correlation matrices.
This transformation is rigorously enforced, i.e., a ﬁnite sample of Gaussiantransformed (preﬁltered) returns data will not yield a covariance matrix equal
to its correlation matrix, so the covariance matrix is properly normalized
(by dividing by the square root of the products of the diagonal elements). This
step affords some statistical robustness of this procedure over moving windows of data.
This gives a multivariate correlated process P in the dy variables, in
terms of Lagrangian L

(20.24)

i

where NCi,t is the current number of broker-ﬁlled contracts of market i at
time t (NC  0 for long and NC  0 for short positions), pi,@,t′ and pi,@,t are
the long/short prices at which contracts were bought/sold according to the
long/short signal sgn(NCi, t′) generated by external models. Note that all
prices are in dollars at this point of the calculation, e.g., including any
required FX transformations. Yt and Yt′ are the dollars available for investment. The function SL is the slippage and commissions suffered by changing the number of contracts.
If trading signals were not generated in this project, aj do not depend on
the prices pi, t , i.e., trading rules dependent on pi, t cannot cause changes
from long (short) to short (long) positions, since trading signals are not
generated for forecast prices pi, t (which TRD can be set to process, as discussed below). However, changes in sgn(NCi, t) still can result from the
sampling process of NC s.
The function sgn(NCi, t) is a multivariate function if trading rules depend
on correlated markets. Furthermore, a proper trading system distinguishes
bid and ask prices, which are taken into account in the trading functions
sgn(NCi, t) and sgn(NCi, t ′) and the cost of trading/cash modiﬁcations that
enter into the calculation of portfolio returns.
If futures are traded, there are no appreciating asset values to buying or
selling contracts; only changes in positions would matter. The proﬁt/loss is
calculated as PLt  Kt  Kt′.
This necessitates ﬁtting risk-managed contract sizes to chosen risk targets for each set of chosen trading rule parameters, e.g., selected by an
optimization algorithm. A given set of trading rule parameters affects the
aj, t and bj, t coefﬁcients as these rules act on the forecasted market prices as
they are generated to sample the multivariate market distributions.
This process must be repeated as the trading rule parameter space is
sampled to ﬁt the trading cost function, e.g., based on proﬁt, Sharpe ratio,
etc., of the portfolio returns.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Once P(dM) is developed (e.g., numerically), risk management optimization
is deﬁned. The portfolio integral constraint is

c h a p t e r 2 0 T R A DING IN R IS K DIM ENSIONS

Q = P ( dM < VaR ) =

−|VaR|

∫ dM P ( M | M )
'

t

−∞

t'

(20.25)

where VaR is a ﬁxed percentage of the total available money to invest, e.g.,
this is speciﬁcally implemented as
VaR  0.05, Q  0.01

(20.26)

where the value of VaR is understood to represent a possible 5 percent loss in
portfolio returns in one epoch, e.g., which approximately translates into a
1 percent chance of a 20 percent loss within 20 epochs. Expected tail loss
(ETL), sometimes called conditional VaR or worst conditional expectation,
can be directly calculated as an average over the tail. While the VaR is useful
in determining expected loss if a tail event does not occur, ETL is useful to
determine what can be lost if a tail event occurs (Dowd, 2002).
ASA (Ingber, 1993) is used to sample future contracts deﬁned by a cost
function, e.g., maximum proﬁt, subject to the constraint
CostQ | Q  0.01|

(20.27)

by optimizing the NC i , t parameters. Other postsampling constraints
described in the following section can then be applied. ( Judgments always
must be made whether to apply speciﬁc constraints, before, during, or after
sampling.)
Note that this deﬁnition of risk does not take into account accumulated
losses over folding of the basic time interval used to deﬁne P(dM), nor does
it address any maximal loss that might be incurred within this interval
(unless this is explicitly added as another constraint function).
Risk management is developed by (ASA-)sampling the space of the next
epoch’s {NCi, t} to ﬁt the above Q constraint using the sampled market variables
{dx}. The combinatoric space of NC s satisfying the Q constraint is huge, and
so additional NC models are used to choose the actual traded {NCi, t}.

SAMPLING MULTIVARIATE
NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
The development of the probability of portfolio returns above certainly is the
core equation, the basic foundation, of most work in the risk management of

295

296

Part iV FOR EIGN EXCHA NGE MARKETS, ALGOR ITHMIC TR ADING, A ND R ISK

portfolios. For general probabilities not Gaussian, and when including correlations, this equation cannot be solved analytically.
Other people approximate/mutilate this multiple integral in an attempt
to achieve some analytic expression. Their results may in some cases serve
as interesting “toy” models to study some extreme cases of variables, but
there is no reasonable way to estimate how much of the core calculation has
been destroyed in this process.
Many people resort to Monte Carlo sampling of this multiple integral.
ASA has an ASA_SAMPLE option that similarly could be applied. However, there are published algorithms speciﬁcally for multivariate normal
distributions (Genz, 1993).
The multivariate correlated dy variables are further transformed into
independent uncorrelated Gaussian dz variables. Multiple normal random
numbers are generated for each dz i variable, subsequently transforming
back to dy, dx, and dp variables to enforce the Dirac δ function constraint
specifying the VaR constraint.
The method of Cholesky decomposition is used (eigenvalue decomposition also could be used, requiring inverses of matrices, which are used elsewhere in this chapter), wherein the covariance matrix is factored into a
product of triangular matrices, simply related to each other by the adjoint
operation. This is possible because G is a symmetric positive-deﬁnite
matrix, i.e., because care has been taken to process the raw data to preserve
this structure, as discussed previously.
G = ( g ij ) = C †C
I = CG −1 C †

(20.28)

from which the transformation of the dy to dz are obtained. Each dz has 0
mean and standard deviation 1, so its covariance matrix is 1
I = < ( dz )† ( dz ) > = < ( dz )† (CG −1 C † )( dz ) >
= < (C † dz )† G −1 (C † dz ) > = < ( dy )† G −1 ( dy ) >

(20.29)

CONCLUSION
The TRD code comprises approximately 50 ﬁles containing about 125
TRD-speciﬁc functions in about 15,000 modiﬁed ASA lines of C code with
about 20,000 TRD-speciﬁc lines of C code. (The ASA C code comprises
seven ﬁles containing about 50 functions.) The code compiles and runs
under gcc or g across platforms, e.g., under ThinkPad/XPPro/Cygwin,
Tadpole/SPARC/Solaris, x86/FreeBSD, Linux, etc.
If nonanalytic distributions must be transformed to copulas, and also
their inverse transformations calculated, this of course requires additional
processing power. ASA has hooks for parallel processing, which have been
used by people in various institutions, for some years now, thus additional
processing could be better accommodated.
Standard Unix scripts are used to facilitate ﬁle and data manipulations.
For example, output plots (e.g., 20 subplots per page for multiple indicators,
positions, prices, etc., versus time of day) for each market for each day’s
trading are developed using RDB (a Perl database tool), Gnuplot, and other
Unix scripts.
TRD is written to run in batch for training and testing of historical
data, and to interface as a function or a DLL call in rea-time with a trading platform, e.g., TradeStation (TS), Fidelity’s Active-Trader WealthLab (WL), etc. Batch mode does not require any connection with a
real-time trading platform. In real-time mode, after checking data, position, and order information, the batch mode code is used to process new
orders, i.e., the same core code is used for real-time, training, and testing,
ensuring that all results are as consistent as possible across these three
modes. If no risk management and no correlations are to be processed,
then TRD can reply asynchronously to multiple markets. Applications can
be developed, including equities and their indexes, futures, forex, and
options.
All trading logic and control is in the “vanilla” C TRD code, e.g., not
using TS EasyLanguage (EL) or WL WealthScript (WS) code, so it can be
used with just about any trading platform, e.g., which compiles and runs
without warnings under gcc or g. For example, TRD interacts with TS
using a DLL prepared using gcc or g under Cygwin.
TRD has an option, DAILY, which trades on daily time scales. This is
useful for training and testing trading systems designed for trading on daily
time scales.

It should be understood that any sampling algorithm processing a huge
number of states can ﬁnd many multiple optima. ASA’s MULTI_MIN
OPTIONS are used to save multiple optima during sampling. Some algorithms might label these states as “mutations” of optimal states. It is important to be able to include them in ﬁnal decisions, e.g., to apply additional
metrics of performance speciﬁc to applications. Experience shows that all
criteria are not best considered by lumping them all into one cost function,
but rather good judgment should be applied to multiple stages of preprocessing and post-processing when performing such sampling.
Within a chosen resolution of future contracts and trading parameters,
the huge numbers of possible states to be importance-sampled presents
multiple optima and sometimes multiple optimal states. While these can be
ﬁltered during sampling with various criteria, it is more useful not to
include all ﬁlters during sampling, but rather to use ASA’s MULTI_MIN
OPTIONS to save any desired number of these optimal states for further
post-processing to examine possible beneﬁts versus risk according to various desired important considerations, e.g., weighting by correlations,
adding additional metrics of performance, etc.
While the theory of copula algorithms relevant to ﬁnancial risk management have been around in published literature for a few years, actual
applications to real markets have generally involved approximations to
probabilit y distributions of data to permit simple analytic derivations.
However, especially in ﬁnancial markets, “the Buddha is in the details,”
where realistic adaptive probability distributions and details of speciﬁc
trades are often required. This chapter details how such computer codes
have been developed for risk management of portfolios for real-time intraday trading.

Development of
a Risk-Monitoring
Tool Dedicated
to Commodity
Trading
Emmanuel Fragnière, Helen O’Gorman, and
Laura Whitney

ABSTRACT
The market of risk management products contains software dedicated to
the ﬁnancial sector, most of which is expensive and not well adapted to
commodity trading. Models often focus on risk metrics as opposed to the
more trader-preferred technical analysis methods of calculating risk. This
chapter presents both risk metrics and technical analysis models, coded
using the programming language Visual Basic for Applications in Excel, as
a means to provide an affordable, reliable, and easily accessible risk-monitoring tool for small trading ﬁrms and individual traders.

INTRODUCTION
Despite the increasing popularit y of commodit y trading, insufficient
research has been conducted with regard to risk management in this sector.
The majority of models are aimed at large ﬁnancial institutions and often

301

302

Part iV FOR EIGN EXCHA NGE MARKETS, ALGOR ITHMIC TR ADING, A ND R ISK

use risk metrics unknown to commodity traders, as opposed to technical
analysis approaches with which they are familiar. In order to help remedy
this problem, the goal of this chapter is to develop an open-source riskmonitoring tool dedicated to the commodity market.
The tool was programmed using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in
Excel with the aim of making it easily accessible to small companies or individual traders. A user interface was designed and macros were written to
perform calculations. The tool’s capabilities include calculating the risk
metric value at risk in several ways, calculating average true range and generating moving averages. Spot price data for corn, soybeans, and soybean
meal were used in its development, but it can also be adapted to other commodities. All three of these commodities are traded on the Chicago Board
of Trade, which is now part of the CME Group.

Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)/CME Group
Established in 1848, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) is the world’s oldest
commodity exchange market. The CBOT was formed to add liquidity to the
market for buyers and sellers, and also to mediate credit risk. It provided a
centralized location where buyers and sellers could negotiate futures contracts.
Today it has more than 3,600 members, who trade more than 50 different
options and futures contracts. In 2003, 454 million contracts were traded,
which broke all previous records. On July 12, 2007, the CBOT merged with
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) under the CME Group holding
company, creating the world’s largest futures exchange.
Corn was one of the original commodities traded on the CBOT. The
ﬁrst forward contract for corn was introduced in 1851; the ﬁrst futures
contracts for other grains were transacted in 1865. Soybeans were added to
the exchange in 1936, and soybean products, such as meal and oil, became
popular after World War II.
In 2008, 60.0 million corn, 36.4 million soybean, and 13.4 million
soybean meal futures contracts were traded. At the end of July 2009, trade
of all three commodities is behind where it was in 2008. Corn shows the
largest decrease: with a current volume of 30.3 million contracts, it is down
21.7 percent. Soybeans are down 9.9 percent, with a current volume of 20.8
million contracts; and soybean meal is down 11.6 percent, with a current
volume of 7.5 million contracts. Volume data can be found on the CME
Group Website.

chapter 21 A RISK-MONITORING TOOL DEDICATED to Commodity Trading

Explanation of the Chapter Structure
This chapter is divided into four sections: the introduction is followed by
the literature review, methodology, and conclusions. The second section of
this chapter, the literature review, explains value at risk, average true range,
and moving averages in detail, including advantages and disadvantages of
using each. The capabilities of the risk-monitoring tool are explained in
this chapter’s third section, the methodology. Conclusions are presented in
this chapter’s ﬁnal section.

LITERATURE REVIEW
This section begins by introducing the risk metric value at risk (VaR) and
presenting several methods of calculating it. This is followed by discussion
of the technical market analysis tools average true range (ATR) and moving
averages.

Value at Risk (VaR)
Value at risk is a summary statistic that measures market risk; it represents
possible portfolio losses under normal market conditions at a speciﬁed conﬁdence level. There are many methods for computing VaR, each with advantages and drawbacks. Delta-normal, historical simulation, and bootstrapping
will be discussed, as well as the veriﬁcation technique of backtesting. All
calculations performed using the risk-monitoring tool produce daily VaR
values, that is, they do not use a holding period.
The delta-normal method is a one-tail test that incorporates the commodit y variance-covariance matrix in order to calculate VaR. This
approach is easily implemented as it assumes that all sources of underlying
risk follow a normal distribution. However, if the risk sources are not
normally distributed, risk can be much higher than what results indicate.
The ﬁrst derivative, delta, is used to measure risk, and the VaR is calculated
by assuming that slight variations in the risk source directly contribute to
proportional slight variations of the commodity’s price over a certain time
horizon.
Historical simulation is simple to compute and requires no assumptions
about the statistical distributions of portfolio profit and loss returns.
Instead, the empirical distribution is calculated by subjecting the current
portfolio to the actual changes in the market factors experienced during

303

304

Part iV FOR EIGN EXCHA NGE MARKETS, ALGOR ITHMIC TR ADING, A ND R ISK

each of the last N periods. VaR is then computed by sorting the returns in
ascending order and ﬁnding the return that represents a loss that is met or
exceeded x percent of the time, where 100 – x is the chosen conﬁdence
level. This approach assumes that past trends will continue in the future,
thus if the last N periods do not exhibit typical behavior, the VaR could be
over- or underestimated.
Bootstrapping is a variation of historical simulation that attempts to
produce more reliable VaR results. This procedure, which is used primarily
to increase the number of data points in a dataset, involves sampling from
the historical data with replacement. As such, no assumptions need to be
made about the underlying statistical distribution. Once sufﬁcient samplings have been completed, VaR is calculated in the same way as it was for
the historical simulation method. An advantage of this method is that it can
take into account departures from a normal or other assumed statistical
distribution. However, it relies heavily on the assumption that returns are
independent and identically distributed, and that there are no cycles or pattern in the data.
In order to ensure that these VaR calculations were not biased in one
way or another, they were tested using the veriﬁcation technique of backtesting. This method compares the calculated VaR to the next day’s proﬁt
and loss returns and counts the number of exceptions; that is, the number
of times returns are greater than the positive VaR or less than the negative
VaR. The Basel Committee has capital requirements for ﬁnancial institutions based on the number of exceptions, but no such requirements exist for
commodity traders.

Average True Range (ATR)
Average true range is a technical analysis aspect of calculating commodity
risk and was ﬁrst mentioned in J. Welles Wilder’s book New Concepts in
Technical Trading Systems in 1978. Wilder was a trader who thought up new
ways to reduce the risks involved in trading, and many of his indicators
were developed bearing commodities in mind. ATR is a method for calculating the volatility of a commodity and incorporates Wilder’s earlier idea
of the “true range.” However, ATR does not determine the direction or
degree of price movement.
ATR uses the opening, high, low, and closing (OHLC) prices of a commodity and takes into consideration the range of the commodity (i.e., the

chapter 21 A RISK-MONITORING TOOL DEDICATED to Commodity Trading

distance the price of the commodity moves per increment of time). The
ATR indicator stemmed from Wilder’s concern that when the limit—that is,
the lowest or highest price the commodity could attain—of a commodity
was reached, the volatilit y would wrongly be calculated as zero as the
OHLC prices remain the same throughout the day when the limit
is reached.
ATR is generally calculated using a 14-day period, as extensive studies
have shown that this gives the most reliable results. It is common to combine this technical analysis method with another indicator, such as support
and resistance levels, to calculate a trader’s stop losses.

Moving Averages
Whereas VaR might be a foreign concept to many commodity traders, they
are undoubtedly familiar with moving averages. These are used in technical
market analysis to ﬁnd the end or reversal of an existing trend, or to identify the beginning of a new trend. As they show only what has happened in
the past and have no forecasting ability, they are known as lagging indicators. A simple moving average (SMA) gives equal weight to all data points,
while recent data points are more heavily weighted in an exponential moving average (EMA). Although the EMA lags behind less than the SMA, it is
also more likely to generate buy or sell signals, some of which will be false
signals.
Multiple moving averages can be used on the same chart: the shorter
time period is more sensitive to changing conditions, while the longer time
period minimizes the effects of any price irregularities. The crossovers
between the two lines represent buying or selling opportunities, depending
if the crossover occurs on an uptrend or a downtrend. The moving average
convergence-divergence (MACD) is used to quantif y the difference
between two moving averages, and is often plotted with a signal line that is
a moving average of the MACD.

METHODOLOGY
The risk-monitoring tool developed performs the following functions: initializing data, calculating VaR (using the delta-normal approach, historical
simulation, and bootstrapping), verifying the VaR models by backtesting,
calculating ATR, and generating moving averages.

User Interface
The ﬁrst tab in the spreadsheet, labeled “Info & Instructions,” contains a
set of instructions giving examples of the correct way to input the dataset
and parameters. It also gives a brief deﬁnition of each risk management
method used in the tool. Figures 21.1 and 21.2 show the instructions and
the top part of the procedures tab as they are found in the tool.
The second tab, labeled “Procedures,” is where the user inputs the
parameters for whichever macro he wants to run. Each risk management
method has its own section with the macro buttons aligned alongside its
corresponding section. The third tab, labeled “Results,” is where the results
of each macro are shown. Similar to the ﬁrst tab, each risk management
macro is assigned its own results section.
The ﬁnal tab, labeled “Data Input,” is where the user inputs the dataset
on which they want to perform risk management calculations. It is important
that the price of each commodity in the portfolio is in the same currency.

VaR Calculations and Model Veriﬁcation
The delta-normal daily VaR was coded using equations that can be found in
the Encyclopedia of Finance (Lee and Lee, 2006, p. 495). First, a loop calculates the arithmetic returns for each commodity in the dataset. Using the
arithmetic returns, the variance-covariance matrix is then calculated in two
parts. The ﬁrst part calculates the diagonal values in the variance-covariance matrix and the second part calculates the rest of the elements in the
matrix. An array is created to hold all of these values.
The variance-covariance matrix and the weights and amounts invested
in each commodity, input by the user in the Data tab, are then used to calculate the portfolio, individual commodity, and commodity component
VaRs. (The commodity component VaR is the individual contribution of
each commodity to the portfolio risk.) Figure 21.3 shows the main steps of
this process.
In order to ﬁnd VaR using the historical simulation method, daily proﬁt
and loss returns are ﬁrst calculated for individual commodities and for the
entire portfolio. Daily portfolio returns are sorted in ascending order. The
amount of the return that is met or exceeded x percent of the time, where x
is 100 minus the conﬁdence level, is the daily VaR. For example, if the user
chose 95 percent conﬁdence, the VaR would be the value that represents a
loss that is met or exceeded 5 percent of the time.

Because the VaR represents a magnitude, its sign does not matter; therefore, although it is negative, it is changed to a positive value. The mean of
all the returns is calculated, and this value is added to the VaR in order to
ﬁnd the relative VaR (relative to the mean). Data is re-sorted in chronological order, and summary information about the VaR is written to the Results
tab. This process is repeated for the individual commodities, and is shown
in Figure 21.4.
In addition to increasing the historical dataset, bootstrapping also
attempts to give more accurate and reliable VaR results by including simulations. As in the historical simulation macro, portfolio proﬁt and loss is ﬁrst
calculated. A speciﬁed number of values n, indicated by the user, are then
randomly selected with replacement from these values. This process is simulated a speciﬁed number of times s, also indicated by the user, and the values are held in an array of dimension n  s.
Each column in the array is sorted in ascending order and the value
corresponding to the appropriate conf idence level is chosen as the
absolute VaR. The average of all of the absolute VaRs is then calculated to
give the overall absolute VaR. The relative VaR is calculated by adding
the mean of all the portfolio proﬁt and loss values to the absolute VaR.
This process is then repeated for each individual commodity, as shown in
Figure 21.5.

In order to verify the effectiveness of these models—delta-normal, historical simulation, and bootstrapping historical simulation—backtesting is
conducted. VaR is calculated for a user-speciﬁed period of time and this
value is compared with the next day’s profit and loss ret urn. This is
repeated for another user-speciﬁed period of time. For example, if the user
would like to use one trading year’s worth of data (252 days) to calculate
VaR and backtest over another 252 days, 252 data points would be used to
calculate the VaR for each of the last 252 days of data in the column.
The positive and negative VaR are recorded as well as the portfolio’s
arithmetic return for the next day. If this return does not fall between the
positive and negative VaR, it is considered an exception. The number and
magnitude of exceptions are totaled up, and shown graphically by presenting those three values—the positive VaR, the negative VaR, and the next
day’s return—on a chart. This allows the user to see when there are exceptions, whether they are above the positive VaR or below the negative VaR,
and their magnitude.

chapter 21 A RISK-MONITORING TOOL DEDICATED to Commodity Trading

Average True Range (ATR)
The ATR indicator uses the OHLC prices of a commodit y. First, the
macro calculates the daily true range (DTR) of the dataset by performing
the following operations: high price minus low price, absolute high price
minus previous closing price, and absolute low price minus previous closing
price. This is shown in Equation (21.1), where t is the time horizon for
measuring DTR.
DTRt = max( H t − Lt , Abs ( H t − C t −1 ), Abs ( Lt − C t −1 )),

∀ 1 < t ≤ 14

DTR1 = H 1 − L1

(21.1)

The 14-day ATR is then calculated using Equation (21.2), where v is the
time horizon for measuring ATR.

Lastly, a graph is drawn plotting the ATR readings over the entire dataset,
as shown in Figure 21.6.

Moving Averages
This macro works for a portfolio of three commodities and uses one trading year of data, or 252 days. Twelve- and 26-day simple moving averages
are calculated using the Excel moving averages add-in, which computes the
following formula:

⎝ N ⎠ i =1

(21.3)

The MACD line, which is the difference between the two SMAs, is calculated next, and from that the signal line is calculated. The signal line is a

CONCLUSION
The risk-monitoring tool developed for this project has the following capabilities: initializing commodity price data input by the user, calculating VaR using
the delta-normal method, calculating VaR using historical simulation, bootstrapping historical simulation, model veriﬁcation by backtesting, calculating
ATR, and generating moving averages. In this way, traders who were previously only familiar with technical market indicators can be introduced to VaR.
The risk metric VaR, calculated at 95 percent conﬁdence, quantiﬁes to
the user the amount he can expect to lose 1 day in 20. It can provide a useful insight into potential losses for an individual commodity and for the
portfolio as a whole; however, it does not take into consideration the potential of extreme outliers. Therefore, VaR can provide a false sense of securit y to traders, and according to some it was a factor in losses made
throughout the subprime crisis.
ATR, on the other hand, portrays price volatility that VaR cannot: it
looks at the commodity’s performance over a certain period and determines
whether the commodity is undergoing an active or a quiet trading period.
However, it cannot determine the direction or duration of price movement
for a commodity. While it is an effective risk management indicator on its
own, it is much more useful if combined with other risk analysis methods,
such as stop and resistance levels. Unfortunately, it is often difﬁcult to ﬁnd
speciﬁc opening, high, low, and closing prices.

The use of multiple moving averages on the same chart in order to generate “buy” and “sell” signals is a tried and tested trading technique. The
moving average with a shorter time period is more sensitive to changing
conditions, while the one with longer time period minimizes the effects of
any price irregularities. Using a crossover between the two is more reliable
than acting when one day’s price crosses the moving average, because any
given price could be an outlier. At the same time, this crossover lags more
and the investor may realize a lower return as a result of waiting for it.
Using VBA in Excel is an effective way to develop a risk-monitoring tool
adapted to the commodity market. It is relatively simple to learn and also
affordable, as anyone who has access to Microsoft applications does not
need to make any further investment to use software programmed in VBA.
Its affordability is important for small companies or individual traders, who
might want the capabilities of big name risk management software but
unfortunately do not have the means with which to purchase it. On the
other hand, a downside to using VBA is that its computational power is
somewhat limited, and as such, it can be slow. Because of this, portfolio size
and complexity is restricted.

ABSTRACT
We examine the consequences of transparency in an experimental multipledealer market with asymmetrically informed dealers. Five professional securities traders make a market for a single security. In each trading round, one
of the dealers (the “insider”) is told the security’s true value. We vary both
pre-trade and post-trade transparency by changing the way quote and trade
information is published. The insider’s proﬁts are greatest when price efﬁciency is lowest. Price efﬁciency, in turn, is reduced by pre-trade transparency and increased by post-trade transparency. Market liquidit y,
measured by dealers’ bid-ask spreads, is improved by pre-trade transparency and reduced by post-trade transparency.

INTRODUCTION
Information is central to the structure and performance of ﬁnancial markets.
Indeed, a primary function of ﬁnancial markets is to assemble and digest
information into an accurate valuation of investment prospects. The interactions among participants—the brokers, dealers, market makers, and specialists transacting on exchange ﬂoors and over-the-counter networks—are
central in this regard. Asymmetric information is thus of obvious importance; the ability of ﬁnancial markets to weigh information from disparate
sources and impound it in prices is basic to their function. We consider the
role of asymmetric information across dealers in an experimental multipledealer securities market, and speciﬁcally its impact on market performance
and the impact of the institutional structure on information aggregation and
dissemination.
Asymmetric information has well-documented and substantial effects on
the performance of ﬁnancial markets, with “insider trading” as the most
important example. We distinguish sharply, however, between traditional
corporate insiders and securities dealers who are better informed than their
peers in a multiple-dealer environment. The nature of interdealer informational asymmetries is fundamentally different from those generated by corporate insiders. Interdealer asymmetries typically arise from information,
such as private order f low or the rumor mill, that should already be
impounded in prices in a semi-strong-form efﬁcient market. On the other
hand, the information available to corporate insiders should only be
impounded in prices if markets are fully strong-form efﬁcient.1 An important empirical question concerns the beneﬁts of interdealer trade. If markets
are not already semi-strong-form efﬁcient, interdealer trading can impound
information from dealers’ private order ﬂow, improving price quality.
We are interested in the interaction between interdealer information
asymmetries and microstructural rules for publication of quote details and
transaction details, because this interaction affects the revelation and aggregation of information. For example, in the 1990s, market makers on the
Stock Exchange Automated Quotation system in London argued for
delayed publication of the details of trades, ostensibly to encourage the provision of liquidity to investors for large transactions (see Ofﬁce of Fair
Trading, 1994). Such delays create interdealer information asymmetries,
allowing an affected dealer to unwind her resulting inventory before her
competitors recognize her predicament. The informational question thus

chapter 22 TR ADING, A SYM METR IC INFORM ATION, and Transparenc y

extends to issues of dealer inventories, risk bearing, and capitalization. More
recently, some exchanges have facilitated “ﬂash trades,” which allow certain
participants very brief advanced knowledge of incoming orders; once again,
the rationale offered by participants is that the mechanism attracts trading
volume and improves liquidity (see The Economist, 2009).
We consider here the publication of both transaction details (post-trade
transparency, e.g., via a public ticker) and live quotes (pre-trade transparency,
e.g., a public limit-order book), and focus on price discovery and transaction costs. As Glosten (1999) emphasizes, the issues and results in this area
can be complex and counterintuitive.2 The obvious presumption is that
increased transparency would always simultaneously speed price discovery
and facilitate counterparty matching and therefore improve both price efﬁciency and transaction costs. The empirical picture is more complex, however, especially regarding pre-trade transparency. Boehmer, Saar, and Yu
(2005), for example, ﬁnd that an increase in pre-trade transparency through
expanded availability of the NYSE’s OpenBook service is associated both
with a decline in effective spreads and an improvement in the informational
efﬁciency of prices. Madhavan, Porter, and Weaver (2005) ﬁnd that increased pre-trade transparency on the Toronto Stock Exchange increases
the risk to limit orders of being “picked off” by other traders, leading to
wider spreads, lower liquidity, and lower stock prices. Simaan, Weaver, and
Whitcomb (2003) ﬁnd a similar relation between pre-trade transparency
and posted spreads in the NASDAQ market. Hendershott and Jones (2005)
ﬁnd that a decrease in pre-trade transparency on the Island electronic communications network is associated with increased autocorrelations in prices,
suggesting that price discovery deteriorates when transparency falls. The
empirical situation for post-trade transparency is more clear-cut. Edwards,
Harris, and Piwowar (2007), Bessembinder, Maxwell, and Venkataraman
(2006), and Goldstein, Hotchkiss, and Sirri (2007), all ﬁnd that increased
post-trade transparency in the U.S. corporate bond market is associated
with narrower spreads and/or lower estimated transaction costs.
It is difﬁcult to study the interaction of microstructure and asymmetric
information using empirical data. Even if it were possible to identify asymmetries, it would still not be feasible to isolate the effect of a static trading
mechanism. We therefore adopt an experimental methodology (see Sunder,
1995 for a survey). Results from prior experimental studies mirror some of
the complexity of the empirical work. Bloomﬁeld and O’Hara (1999) and

321

322

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

Flood, Huisman, Koedijk, and Röell (FHKR, 1997) both ﬁnd that posttrade transparency does speed price discovery. On the other hand, Flood,
Huisman, Koedijk, and Mahieu (FHKM, 1999) f ind that increased
pre-trade transparency actually slows price discovery in a multiple-dealer
market; they conclude that dealers in an opaque market reprice more
aggressively to attract order ﬂow. In contrast, dealers in a pre-trade transparent market can typically offer much smaller price improvements and
nonetheless guarantee a place atop the public limit order book. Our study
differs from most experimental double-auction studies (but not all; see
Forsythe, Palfrey, and Plott, 1982; and Plott and Sunder, 1982), in that our
traders can both buy and sell the asset. Moreover, all our dealers act as market makers, providing bid-ask quotes to other dealers at all times.
Our market framework is based on Glosten and Milgrom’s (1985) model;
it is a quote-driven, continuous securities market in which ﬁve market makers trade a single imaginary security. We use three groups of professional
securities dealers as experimental subjects. The market makers set quotes
and trade with each other and with computerized external customers. The
latter are either informed traders or noise traders. In each trading round,
one of the market makers is randomly chosen to be the “insider,” who
knows the underlying value of the security. Since he is a market maker, he
both trades and competes on price with the other market makers. In these
experiments, we use the notion of pre-trade and post-trade transparency to
distinguish between four different trading mechanisms. Following Pagano
and Röell (1996), we deﬁne pre-trade transparency as the amount of quoted
price information available to market makers, and post-trade transparency
as the amount of transaction information available to market makers.
We measure the relative private gains (in terms of insider proﬁts) and public
gains (in terms of speed of price discovery and size of dealer spreads) associated with various trading mechanisms when information asymmetries
are present.
The contribution of this study is three-fold. First, we consider four
different trading mechanisms in which we explicitly distinguish between
pre-trade and post-trade transparency in our analysis. (Other studies examining insider trading in different trading mechanisms use a quite general
notion of transparency; see, e.g., Pagano and Röell, 1996, and Schnitzlein,
1996.) The distinction between price and transaction information is important, as the different types of information ﬂows have different effects on
market outcomes. It is also important in terms of intermarket competition,

chapter 22 TR ADING, A SYM METR IC INFORM ATION, and Transparenc y

as competing exchanges worldwide implement trading mechanisms that
indeed differ in the levels of both pre-trade and post-trade transparency.
Second, we use an experimental setting in which continuous trading is
possible. This provides us with extensive time-series data: thousands of
transactions and hundreds of quote settings for each of the trading mechanisms. Most experimental studies on microstructure have only a fraction of
this available. Moreover, we use professional market makers as the subjects
in our experiment. This is an important advantage over experiments using
students as subjects.
Third, we offer an alternative view of asymmetric information by giving
the insider a different role compared with other studies (e.g., Kyle, 1985;
Glosten and Milgrom, 1985; Easley and O’Hara, 1992; and Schnitzlein,
1996). Generally, the insider is regarded as an external customer submitting
orders to the ﬁnancial market. Market makers then compete for the order
via their quoted prices, and the order is typically executed against the best
price. In contrast, our insider is a market maker, competing directly on
price with other market makers. (Lyons, 1996, for example, examines the
role of private order ﬂow as a source of interdealer information asymmetries in a multiple-dealer market.) Our setup is closest institutionally to
multiple-dealer markets such as NASDAQ, the London Stock Exchange, or
the foreign exchange market.
We ﬁnd an inverse connection between insider proﬁts and price efﬁciency.
Slow price discovery allows insiders greater opportunities to accumulate
speculative inventories at advantageous prices. At the same time, however,
we ﬁnd that post-trade transparency (e.g., a public ticker) improves price
discovery, while pre-trade transparency reduces price discovery. Consequently, post-trade transparency reduces insider proﬁts, while pre-trade
transparency increases them. Meanwhile, increased pre-trade transparency
reduces dealers’ uncertainty and reduces market liquidity (as measured by
bid-ask spreads), while post-trade transparency induces dealers to compete
for private order ﬂow, thus reducing spreads and increasing liquidity.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND TERMINOLOGY
This section brieﬂy presents the experimental setup. For a full description
of the experiments we refer to Flood, Koedijk, van Dijk, and van Leeuwen
(FKDL, 2002), which is an earlier working paper version of this study that
contains all the details about the experimental setup. Our tests involve a

323

324

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

computerized experimental securities market in which a number of human
dealers (including one with an information advantage, the “insider”) trade
continuously with each other and a computerized, non-market-making customer (the “robot”) for a single imaginary security.

Market Design
Our experimental microstructure is a continuous multiple-dealer version of
the pure dealership market used by Glosten and Milgrom (1985). This
market is quote driven, in the sense that the specialist ﬁrst sets quotes and
then confronts orders from traders. This is the main difference between
our experimental design and Kyle’s (1985) order-driven framework in
which the market maker determines a market-clearing price for a batch of
orders. (See Madhavan, 1992 for an overview of the differences between
quote-driven and order-driven markets.)

The Role of the Dealers
A priori, the security’s true (underlying) value is unknown to all human
dealers but one. Each participant is the insider in either two or three
rounds. All dealers are informed that there is exactly one insider in every
round. The true value is revealed publicly at the end of each trading round.
Dealers are instructed to maximize their end-of-round wealth by trading on
the security. Wealth is expressed in esquires (a ﬁctional numéraire currency). Dealers can gain or lose wealth during each round by buying and
selling the security (i.e., by jobbing) and by building a long or short inventory of the security that is converted into cash at the security’s true value at
the end of each round (speculating). The true value is set at random and
differs in each practice and session round (the values are available from the
authors). Trading in every round can be regarded as trading for a new security. At the start of each round, the non-insider only knows that the true
value in that round is uniformly distributed over [1,200].

Quoting, Trading, and Pre-Trade Transparency
At the start of each round, each dealer is obliged to enter a quote (that is, a
bid price and an ask price) within 10 seconds. Dealers who fail to enter an
initial quote within the ﬁrst 10 seconds are penalized at the rate of 10
esquires per second after that, until an initial quote is entered. Thereafter,

chapter 22 TR ADING, A SYM METR IC INFORM ATION, and Transparenc y

every dealer always has a quote outstanding, at which the other market
makers and the robot can trade. The maximum individual spread is limited
to 30 esquires.
The primary parameters in our experiments are the level of pre-trade
transparency and the level of post-trade transparency. Both variables can
assume one of two values: high or low. When the level of pre-trade transparency is high (“full quote disclosure”), all outstanding price quotes appear
continuously on the trading screen of each market maker. Bid and ask
prices appear in separate queues in the center of the screen. Next to every
price, the identity of the dealer (human or robot) who quoted this price
appears. If at any time the bid (ask) price of several dealers is the same, then
the most recently quoted price is at the top. When a dealer opts to buy
(sell), he automatically does so at the lowest (highest) quoted ask (bid) price.
When the level of pre-trade transparency is low (“no quote disclosure”),
no price information is publicly available. Instead, prices and transactions
are communicated on a strictly bilateral basis. Dealers call each other to
obtain price quotes. The dealer who receives a call does not respond
actively. She does not even notice that she is being called; instead, her most
recently quoted bid and ask prices automatically appear on the caller’s
screen. Then, the caller has the option to buy, sell, or do nothing.

Transaction Information and Post-Trade Transparency
A high level of post-trade transparency implies that there is full and immediate trade disclosure. The information appears in a transaction history
window on the trading screen and consists of the identities of the buyer and
seller, the transaction size (which always equals one share in our setup) and
the price at which the transaction cleared. When the level of post-trade
transparency is low, only transactions in which a particular dealer was
involved are listed in his window. There is no delay in trade disclosure.

Robot Behavior
The robot is programmed to trade every 7 seconds against the best prices
in the market. Prior to each robot transaction, it is determined by chance
whether the trade is an informed or an uninformed one. The noise level—
i.e., the a priori probability α that a trade is informed—equals 0.5 in all
rounds. At the start of the experiment, the dealers are told this probability.

325

326

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

Given their knowledge of the probability that a robot is informed (α),
dealers may be able to ﬁlter relevant price information by observing robot
transactions.
If the robot initiates an informed trade, it buys (sells) if the lowest ask
price (highest bid price) at that time is below (above) the true value of the
securit y. The robot does not trade if quoted bid-ask spreads surround
the true value. Note that the robot maximizes its expected proﬁts only at
the trade level; there is no dynamic strategy. If a robot initiates an uninformed trade, a binomial random draw (with probability one half ) determines whether the robot sells or buys; if it sells (buys), it does so against the
highest bid price (lowest ask price) available.

Rounds and Parameters
We ran the experiments with three groups of human subjects. Each group
traded in two “sessions” consisting of six 5-minute trading rounds per session. To control for possible learning effects, the ﬁrst group started with a
session with no quote disclosure, and then moved on to a session of full
quote disclosure; the second group followed the opposite sequence. The
third group followed the same sequence as the ﬁrst. Within each session,
post-trade transparency alternated between low and high from round to
round. Each trading session followed two 5-minute practice rounds, one in
which the level of post-trade transparency was low and the other in which it
was high. The practice rounds acquaint the subjects with the trading system
and provide a chance to ask questions. In the “real” (i.e., the non-practice)
rounds, subjects were paid for their results. The data reported here come
from the real sessions. At the end of each round, all dealers learn their ﬁnal
wealth. Esquires are translated into Dutch guilders according to a payment
scheme that is explained to the dealers before the start of the experiment
(1 USD 艐1.75 NLG). In every round, 15 guilders are divided among all
market makers, making this a ﬁxed-sum game. Details on the payment
scheme are provided in FKDL (2002).

DATA
The data were collected from experiments held at the laboratory of the
Center for Research in Experimental Economics and Political Decision
Making (CREED) at the University of Amsterdam. The subjects in the

chapter 22 TR ADING, A SYM METR IC INFORM ATION, and Transparenc y

ﬁrst experiment, conducted on January 27, 1997, are ﬁve professional
option traders from Optiver. In the second experiment, conducted on
3 February 1997, ﬁve professional equity traders from ABN Amro Bank, de
Generale Bank, and Oudhoff Effecten participated. These subjects acted as
market makers in 12 independent rounds, divided into two six-round sessions. The third replication, involving ﬁve professional options traders from
Amsterdam Options Traders, was conducted on April 21, 1999. Unfortunately, an operating system failure at the CREED lab forced us to abandon
this set of replications before we were done. Eight rounds of usable data
were produced, however. Table 22.1 presents some basic summary statistics.

RESULTS
In this section, we analyze the speed of price discovery, the level of insider
proﬁtability, and the bid-ask spreads (as measures of efﬁciency, unfairness,
and liquidity, respectively) as a function of pre-trade and post-trade transparency. We consider the f ull-factorial 2 2 matrix of transparency
arrangements. We adopt a two-letter notational shorthand, in which the
ﬁrst letter indicates pre-trade transparency and the second letter indicates
post-trade transparency. For example, “HL” indicates a high pre-trade and
low post-trade transparency regime.

Price Efﬁciency
Following Bloomfield and O’Hara (1999), FHKR (1997), and FHKM
(1999), we use price errors to measure the informational efﬁciency of prices
in the market. We deﬁne price errors as the absolute difference between the
average midpoint of all outstanding quotes and the underlying value of the
security. Our hypothesis on the effect of transparency on price efﬁciency is
based on the results of, among others, Bloomﬁeld and O’Hara (1999),
FHKR (1997), and Pagano and Röell (1996). These studies find that
increasing post-trade transparency leads to greater efﬁciency. The presumption would be that it is relatively hard for insiders to hide private
information when transaction information is widely available to the
non-insider market makers. In contrast, FHKM (1999) ﬁnd a search-cost
effect that causes increased pre-trade transparency to reduce efﬁciency in a
multiple-dealer market.
Figure 22.1 shows the average price error time path for each of the four
trading mechanisms. Since the only ex ante information that the uninformed market makers have about the underlying value is that it lies
between 1 and 200, their best initial guess should be that the underlying
value is around 100. This guess is reﬂected in the value of the price error at
the beginning of each round, which is generally close to the absolute difference between the true value and 100. As shown in Figure 22.1 and the last
panel of Table 22.1, price errors clearly move towards zero after the ﬁrst
20 seconds, a pattern observed in all four trading mechanisms.

Time (in seconds)
Figure 22.1 shows the average price errors for each combination of transparency variables; e.g., “low, high”
refers to low pre-trade and high post-trade transparency. Price errors are deﬁned as the absolute difference
between the true value of the security and the average midpoint of outstanding quotes. The price errors are
averaged across all rounds with the speciﬁed combination of transparency variables. The ﬁrst 20 seconds of
each round are omitted, to allow time for all dealers to submit their ﬁrst quotes.

Price errors decline as more information about the underlying value of
the security is brought into the market. By deﬁnition, the better the market’s ability to transmit information, the faster price errors decline. While
the average price error paths in Figure 22.1 disguise considerable roundto-round variation in initial errors and convergence rates, the most and
least transparent cases (HH and LL) appear to perform well relative to the
others. This supposition is borne out by a more controlled statistical analysis. In Table 22.2, we average price errors across all three groups and all
rounds with a common transparency regime. Averages of dealer spread
midpoints are taken at 50-second intervals throughout the trading round
(plus an early reading after the ﬁrst 20 seconds of trading), and are normalized by the starting error for the round. (The starting error is deﬁned
as abs(100 – TrueValue), since the expected starting quote for the uninformed dealers is 100.) Normalization compensates for differences in the

Table 22.2 presents normalized price errors for four different transparency regimes. The normalized price
errors are based on the absolute difference between the true value of the security in each round and the
average midpoint of all outstanding quotes. The errors are then averaged over eight rounds to obtain the
average price errors for each trading mechanism. The results are corrected for the average initial price error
in each transparency regime, so that price errors are directly comparable across trading mechanisms. The
initial price error is deﬁned as abs (100 – TrueValue).

true value of the security across rounds, allowing meaningful averages and
comparisons. The bulk of price discovery occurs during the ﬁrst 150 seconds of trading, and the HH and LL regimes clearly outperform HL and
LH over this interval. After 150 seconds, average price errors are over
twice as large for HL (38 percent) and LH (36 percent) as they are for
either HH (17 percent) or LL (15 percent).
More formally, we estimate an individual effects panel model to examine
the price efﬁciency in each of the four different trading mechanisms used in
the experiments. We regress the price errors obtained in all 32 rounds on a
constant, 32 individual-round dummies and four trend dummies. The
dummy variables are included to isolate the effects of transparency. The
estimated equation is
32

Ptr − TrueValuer = β0 + ∑ βi I( r = i ) +
i =1

∑

βk I( r = k )t + ε tr

(22.1)

k= LL , LH , HL , HH

where t denotes time in seconds and r the trading round, Ptr is the average
midpoint over all bid and ask quotes at time t, I(·) is a dummy variable for
trading round and trading mechanism, and εtr is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) error term. Since dealers’ behavior changes after price
discovery is achieved—trends in prices typically level off abruptly at this
point—we discard observations after the point in time at which price errors

chapter 22 TR ADING, A SYM METR IC INFORM ATION, and Transparenc y

have converged to a value less than or equal to 5. Moreover, we omit transactions completed in the ﬁrst 20 seconds of each trading round to ensure that
all market makers have submitted bid and ask quotes. Ordinary least squares
(OLS) estimates for Equation (22.1) are presented in Table 22.3. Larger negative values for the slope coefﬁcient imply faster price discovery. The
estimates of the 32 individual-round dummies represent differences in the
underlying value in each round and the identity of the insider. They are omitted to conserve space.
Table 22.3 generally conﬁrms the conclusions from Table 22.2, with the
exception that the LL regime does not perform relatively as well in the
regression analysis as it did in Table 22.2. Table 22.3 thus largely supports
the hypothesis that efﬁciency is greater when transparency is higher. The
results show a clear ranking of the different trading mechanisms, although
estimates of the slope coefﬁcients in Table 22.3 are not signiﬁcantly different from one another at a 5 percent level.3
The exception to the notion that more transparency is better is the
least transparent microstructure (LL), in which efﬁciency is better than
in the case with high pre-trade and low post-trade transparency (HL);
this difference is marginally statistically signiﬁcant. This conﬁrms the

earlier work of FHKM (1999), who ﬁnd that price discovery is faster
under LL than HL; they argue that search costs can explain this counterintuitive result, as high pre-trade transparency reduces the incentives for
aggressive price improvements. The results of Table 22.3 also conﬁrm the
conclusions of FHKR (1997), who ﬁnd that price discovery is faster under
LH than LL.
Lastly, we consider the implications of conditioning on only one of the
transparency variables at a time. Row A of Table 22.4 reports the results of
estimating a modiﬁed version of Equation (22.1), in which there are only
two transparency dummies, based on the degree of pre-trade transparency
(i.e., the HL and HH and the LL and LH rounds are pooled). The difference across coefﬁcients for the pooled groups is marginally signiﬁcant, and
the search-cost effect described by FHKM (1999) appears to dominate:
price discovery is faster when pre-trade transparency is low. Similarly, row
B pools the HL and LL rounds (as well as the LH and HH rounds) to
examine the impact of post-trade transparency. In this case, the transparency effect described by FHKR (1997) seems to dominate, as price discovery is faster when post-trade transparency is high. This difference is also
marginally statistically signiﬁcant.

Insider Proﬁts
Our evidence thus far indicates that the speed of price discovery is positively dependent on market transparency, with the exception that the least
transparent regime (LL) performs relatively well in this regard. With this
exception, then, we expect a generally inverse relation between insider profits and transparency, since insider proﬁtability should be inversely related to
the speed of price discovery (faster price discovery reduces the insider’s
ability to acquire inventory at advantageous prices). This expectation is
consistent with the conclusions of Bloomfield and O’Hara (1999) and
Pagano and Röell (1996).
When the true value is extreme (i.e., far from 100), insiders are likely to
make larger proﬁts than when it is moderate. As this effect is not due to
transparency differences, we normalize total insider proﬁts by the absolute
difference between the true value and 100 in each round. Moreover, we
look at both average insider proﬁts and average insider proﬁts per transaction. Although it does not affect our conclusions, we regard the latter number as more meaningful, as the number of transactions differs substantially
across trading mechanisms (search costs impose a logistical obstacle that
reduces transaction rates substantially in the LL case). The penultimate
section of Table 22.1 presents insider proﬁts (and average outsider losses)
under each trading mechanism, averaged across all rounds. Unsurprisingly,
outsider losses are closely related to insider proﬁts. More importantly,
insider proﬁts are smallest in the most transparent market (HH), which was
also the market in which price discovery occurred most quickly. Interestingly, however, the least transparent market (LL) shows similarly small
insider proﬁts, a fact consistent with its relatively speedy price discovery,
established in the preceding subsection.
We again estimate a ﬁxed effects panel model in which we regress total
proﬁts per transaction in each of 32 rounds on four trading mechanism
dummies. The model is given in Equation 22.2.

= ∑ βi I( r = i ) +

where r denotes the trading round, πr is the average insider proﬁt (either
normalized by the number of transactions or non-normalized) in round

r, I(·) is a dummy variable for trading mechanism and εr is an i.i.d. error
term. OLS estimates of Equation (22.2) appear in Table 22.5. Estimates of
the 32 individual-round dummies are omitted from the table to conserve
space. Again, we see that insider proﬁts are lowest in the most transparent
(HH) and least transparent (LL) cases.4 On the other hand, insiders are best
off in the mixed-transparency cases (HL and LH). The pairwise differences
in regression slope coefﬁcients between the HH case and each of the two
mixed-transparency cases (i.e., HH vs. HL, and HH vs. LH) are marginally
signiﬁcant. We conclude that insider proﬁtability is inversely and causally
related to the speed of price discovery in the market.
As with price discovery, we also consider the implications of conditioning on only one transparency variable at a time. Table 22.6 reports insider
proﬁts averaged across each subsample of rounds. Row A of Table 22.6
pools results based on pre-trade transparency, with the pooled LL and LH
results (pooled HL and HH results) in the ﬁrst (second) column. Row B
similarly pools LL and HL (LH and HH) in the ﬁrst (second) column.
Although the standard errors are too large for either of the intercolumn
differences to be statistically signiﬁcant, the pattern in the calculated averages ﬁts neatly with the results in Table 22.4. We conﬁrm our conclusion
that price discovery is the determining factor for our insider proﬁtability
results.

chapter 22 TR ADING, A SYM METR IC INFORM ATION, and Transparenc y

In sum, the results for insider proﬁts show a clear negative relation
between insider proﬁts and the speed of price discovery, as anticipated.
However, because the relation between price discovery and transparency is
a nonlinear one, the relation between insider proﬁts and transparency is
similarly nonlinear.

Spreads
The spread between market makers’ bid and ask quotes is generally assumed
to consist of three different components: order-processing costs, inventoryholding costs, and adverse-selection costs. The ﬁrst two components are
nominally equal to zero in our experiments, and we focus on the latter.
The standard adverse-selection component represents compensation to the
dealer for losses to informed investors. However, a number of papers (e.g.,
Madhavan, 1995) argue that dealers in a multiple-dealer market should narrow their spreads in an effort to “purchase” informative order ﬂow, with the
goal of exploiting the resulting information in subsequent trading, a tactic
that should be enforced by interdealer competition. Thus, adverse-selection
costs subsume both the degree of uncertainty in the market and the degree
of (imperfect) competition.
The existing literature also indicates that an explicit distinction between
pre-trade and post-trade transparency is necessary when examining the relation between transparency and bid-ask spreads. Pagano and Röell (1996) ﬁnd
that the spread size decreases when more price information is available in the
market. The argument is that uncertainty decreases when market makers

know more about each other’s quotes. On the other hand, Bloomﬁeld and
O’Hara (1999) ﬁnd that spreads increase when more transaction information
becomes available in the market. Madhavan’s (1995) model concludes that
market makers compete more ﬁercely when they cannot observe other market
makers’ transactions, since in this case they must attract transactions to
themselves to gain the information implicit in the order ﬂow. We thus conjecture that reduced pricing uncertainty under pre-trade transparency should
reduce spreads, while reduced competition under post-trade transparency
should increase them. This conjecture translates to the following four
hypotheses: (1) SLL  SHL; (2) SLH  SHH; (3) SHH  SHL; and (4) SLH  SLL;
where Sk is the average spread size under trading regime k.
Figure 22.2 shows the average outsider spreads in the four different
microstructures for all three groups of subjects. The average spread in each
trading round is deﬁned as the average size of the spread between the bid

Time (in seconds)
Figure 22.2 shows the average spread size in each of the trading mechanisms, measured as the average
bid-ask spread of all outside dealers in the relevant trading rounds. None of our spread results is changed
markedly by including or excluding the insider. The initial spreads are high and similar in each trading
mechanism, but spreads decrease as information is brought into the market over time. The spreads are
nearly uniformly consistent with our hypothesis. For at least the ﬁrst 230 seconds of trading, the average
spread size is lowest when pre-trade transparency is high and post-trade transparency is low, indicating that
uncertainty is relatively low and competition relatively severe. The reverse holds for the LH market, in
which spreads are relatively large.

Table 22.7 presents the effect of transparency on dealer spreads by averaging the spreads over two different
transparency regimes. In the ﬁrst row (case A), average outsider spreads in LL and LH rounds are computed
(ﬁrst column), as are HL and HH (second column), to examine the effect of conditioning solely on pre-trade
transparency. In the second row (case B), average outsider spreads in LL and HL are calculated, as are LH
and HH for a similar analysis of the effect post-trade transparency. Standard deviations are in parentheses.

and ask quotes of all market makers. The lines in this graph were constructed by averaging the spreads of eight individual rounds with the same
trading mechanism. The ﬁrst 20 seconds of each trading round were omitted from the calculation, as dealers used this time period to enter their ﬁrst
bid and ask quotes.
To buttress the evidence in Figure 22.2, Table 22.7 presents the average
outsider spreads pooled for all trading rounds with the speciﬁed transparency treatment. For example, row A of Table 22.7 presents in the ﬁrst
(second) column the average outsider spread for all LL and LH (HL and
HH) rounds. As predicted, increased pre-trade transparency narrows dealer
spreads. Similarly, in row B, we see that increased post-trade transparency
increases spreads. The predictions of our hypothesis continue to hold under
a ﬁner-grained analysis. Thus, on average, SLL  23.9, SLH  25.1, SHL 
20.1, and SHH  21.1. Although neither of the intercolumn differences in
Table 22.7 is statistically signiﬁcant at the 5 percent level, our hypothesis is
nonetheless clearly supported by the available evidence.

CONCLUSION
In this study, we follow the recommendations of Leland (1992), Pagano and
Röell (1996), and Schnitzlein (1996) to examine the extent to which market
microstructure interacts with asymmetric information to affect market performance. Speciﬁcally, we consider an experimental multiple-dealer market
in which one of the dealers begins with fundamental information unavailable
to the other dealers. We create four different trading mechanisms by varying
the following two transparency rules: the pre-trade publication of dealer

337

338

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

quotes (private information or broadcast) and the post-trade publication of
transactions (public ticker or private information). The characteristics of the
trading mechanism affect how difﬁcult it is for uninformed dealers to detect
an insider and infer his strategies; conversely, they affect the ability of the
insider to exploit his informational advantage.
We obtain our data from a series of 5-minute trading rounds for three
groups of ﬁve professional securities traders. Our results clearly indicate an
inverse connection between insider proﬁts and the price efﬁciency of the
market. Slow price discovery allows insiders greater opportunities to accumulate speculative inventories at advantageous prices. However, the connection between insider profitabilit y and transparency is somewhat more
complex, because the connection between transparency and price efﬁciency
is nonlinear. Post-trade transparency (e.g., a public ticker) improves efﬁciency. Conversely, however, and consistent with the earlier work of FHKM
(1999), pre-trade transparency in our multiple-dealer market slows price
discovery and increases insider proﬁtability. Market liquidity, measured by
average bid-ask spreads, behaves consistently with theoretical predictions.
Increased pre-trade transparency reduces dealers’ uncertainty and reduces
spreads. Eliminating post-trade transparency creates an incentive for dealers to compete for private order ﬂow, thus reducing spreads.

Moreover, the potential social beneﬁts of insider trading-namely, that it
draws insiders into the market to reveal their information via trading
(see Leland, 1992)—do not obtain as readily for asymmetrically
informed dealers, since by deﬁnition dealers are already active in the
market. Note that, in many markets, dealers broker trades for corporate
insiders, so that the dealer effectively becomes a surrogate corporate
insider.
The main theoretical issues are considered by O’Hara (1995), and
Pagano and Röell (1996).
We also attempted to conﬁrm whether these slope estimates differ
signiﬁcantly from one another, based on matched-pair tests of the
transparency effect, calculated with robustness to heteroscedasticity.
Holding constant one transparency dimension (e.g., ﬁxing low posttrade transparency and comparing LL vs. HL), we compared the difference in slopes (e.g., HL  LL  0.069). There are four such
comparisons: LL vs. HL; LH vs. HH; LL vs. LH; and HL vs. HH. In
none of the comparisons is the difference in slopes signiﬁcant at a 95%
conﬁdence threshold.
Once again, we performed matched-pair comparisons across regimes
of the slope coefﬁcient for insider proﬁts (i.e., the ﬁnal column in
Table 22.5). Once again, in none of the four comparisons do the coefﬁcients differ signiﬁcantly at a 95% conﬁdence threshold.

Arbitrage Risk and
the High-Volume
Return Premium
G. Geoffrey Booth and Umit G. Gurun

ABSTRACT
This chapter provides new insights into the visibility hypothesis, which
maintains that increased attention to a stock should attract and convince
more investors to buy the stock. We ﬁnd a negative relation between arbitrage risk and abnormal trading volume, and we provide empirical evidence
that arbitrage risk helps explain the previously documented high-volume
return premium.

INTRODUCTION
Miller (1977) argues that increased attention to a stock should attract
more investors and convince them to buy the stock. His argument is used
by Gervais, Kaniel, and Mingelgrin (2001) to explain the relationship
between abnormal trading activity and subsequent price increases, but
does not address why particular stocks experience high trading volume
in the ﬁrst place. We conjecture that stocks with low arbitrage risk are
more likely to experience abnormal trading activit y when their prices
deviate from their fundamentals, and we postulate that this trading signals
the intentions of the traders. Thus, in a market where short sales

343

344

Pa rt V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

are restricted, stocks with substitutes are more likely to be “visible” when
they are underpriced.

DATA AND METHOD
To test our conjecture, we classif y stocks into groups based on their
observable visibility attributes. We use abnormal shares traded and ﬁrm size
for our measures of visibility. Using Gervais, Kaniel, and Mingelgrin’s
(2001) approach, we split daily data from the Center for Research in Security Prices for NYSE stocks between July 1, 1963 and December 31, 2006
into 216 nonintersecting intervals of 50 trading days. Each interval is
divided into a reference period, the ﬁrst 49 days, and a formation day, the
50th day. The reference period acts as a benchmark to judge how unusual
the trading volume is in the formation period. In a trading interval, a stock
is classiﬁed as a high (low) volume stock if its formation period volume is in
the top (bottom) decile of the 50 daily volume samples. All NYSE Common stocks are considered except those with missing data, those with a
price of below $5 at the month end, and those that experienced an earnings
announcement during the 3-day window centered on the formation day. We
separated the sample in three parts according to company size (market capitalization) and calculated the return on high- and low-volume stocks. We
classify the ﬁrms in size deciles 9 and 10 as large size, those in deciles
6 through 8 as medium size, and those in deciles 2 to 5 as small size. Firms
in the ﬁrst decile are excluded because most do not survive the ﬁlters. This
procedure eliminates sample selection bias and reduces the dependency
between observations in different trading intervals. Moreover, the 50-day
difference between observations minimizes any systematic biases that
caused by calendar anomalies. We end up with 16,126 small-size/low-volume, 15,204 small-size/high-volume, 10,234 medium-size/low-volume,
10,430 medium-size/high-volume, 6,387 large-size/low-volume and 6,812
large-size/high-volume stocks.
On the formation date, we create portfolios based on the trading volume
classiﬁcation of the stocks in the corresponding reference period. We construct
zero-investment portfolios by longing a total of $1 in all high-volume stocks in
a size group and shorting a similar short position in all low-volume stocks in
that same group. Each stock in the high- (low-) volume category is given equal
weight. The cumulative returns of high-volume, low-volume, and zero-investment portfolios for different size groups are summarized in Table 23.1. Our

results conﬁrm the high-volume premium documented by Gervais, Kaniel, and
Mingelgrin (2001) for a marginally longer data period using slightly different
methods. The cumulative return differential between high-volume and lowvolume stocks is statistically positive for all size groups (all p values .00). Furthermore, the high-volume return premium is more apparent for small than
large companies.
We use three approaches to measure the arbitrage risk. First, following
Wurgler and Zhuravskaya (2002), our measure of a portfolio’s arbitrage risk
at time t is based on the following ordinary least squares (OLS) regression:
RP ,i - RRF ,i = α + β M (R M ,i - RRF ,i ) + ε t ,

(23.1)

where i  t – 1, t – 2,…, t – k (k is the estimation window length). RP,i
corresponds to return to portfolio P at time i. RRF,i corresponds to riskfree rate and RM,i represents the market return. This approach assumes
that market is a close substitute for any diversiﬁed portfolio. The root
mean square error of the regression captures the volatility of the zeroinvestment portfolios, i.e., the arbitrage risk of the investment strategy.
For each high-volume and low-volume portfolio for various size groups,
we calculate the variance of residuals and the standard error of regression
using the previous 250 days.
Second, we estimate the following four-factor model’s root mean
square error to calculate a measure arbitrage risk that is orthogonal to
well documented risk factors:
RP, i  RRF,i  α  βM (RM,i  RRF,i)  βH HMLi  βS SMBt,i
 βU UMDt i  εt

(23.2)

345

346

Pa rt V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

where i  t  1, t  2,…, t  k and R P,i, R RFi, and R Mi are previously
deﬁned. The purpose of adding other factors to Equation (23.1) is to
capture the idiosyncratic risk that potentially creates major obstacles for the
arbitrageur. We use book-to-market (high minus low, or HML) and size
(small minus big, or SMB) to control for other sources of risk. HML and
SMB are obtained from Kenneth French’s Web site. To control for possible
momentum effects, we use the six value-weighted portfolios formed on size
and prior 2- to 12-month returns. The portfolios are the intersections of
the two portfolios formed on size and the three portfolios formed on prior
return. The monthly size breakpoint is the median NYSE market equity.
The monthly prior ret urn breakpoints are the 30th and 70th NYSE
percentiles. Momentum (up minus down, or UMD) is the average return
on the two high prior return portfolios minus the average return on the
two low prior return portfolios. We do not include a liquidity variable in
Equation (23.2) because Gervais, Kaniel, and Mingelgrin (2001) show that
liquidity is not an explanation for the high-volume return premium, but our
conclusions are not affected if we do.
Third, we create a ﬁfth risk factor, LMS, which is the average return
on the portfolio that longs stocks in the top 20th percentile of arbitrage
risk and shorts stocks in the lowest 20th percentile of arbitrage risk.
Arbitrage risk for individual stocks is calculated based on OLS regression
found in Equation (23.2). Sorting based on arbitrage risk is performed
before the trading interval i; therefore, it is information available to
investors before the portfolio formation period. If arbitrage risk is indeed
higher for less visible stocks, then inclusion of LMS (long minus short)
should reduce or eliminate the alpha differential between most visible and
less visible portfolios.

TESTS
The ﬁrst implication of our conjecture is that arbitrage risk of visible stocks
should be lower than that of less visible ones. This translates into comparing arbitrage risk of high-volume stocks and low-volume stocks within the
same size group, and large-size and small-size ﬁrms within the same volume group. In Table 23.2, we report that high-volume stocks have lower
arbitrage risk than low-volume stocks regardless of size ﬁrms (p values ).01)
and that large-size ﬁrms have lower arbitrage risk than small-size ﬁrms

regardless of volume (p values .00). These results support the notion that
arbitrage risk may be capable of explaining the high-volume premium.
The p values (in parentheses) in Panel A show the results of the one-tailed
null hypothesis that arbitrage risk of high-volume stocks is greater than that
of low-volume stocks. The p values (in parentheses) in Panel B show the
results of the one-tailed null hypothesis that arbitrage risk of large-size ﬁrms
is greater than that of small-size ﬁrms. We estimate Equation (23.2) with and
without LMS for the more and less visible portfolios for all 216 20-day trading intervals. The results are displayed in Table 23.3. These indicate that
four-factor model alone cannot account for the return premium across highand low-volume portfolios for all ﬁrm size groups. The alpha differences in
all size groups are signiﬁcant and positive. However, if the LMS factor is
included in the four-factor model, the alpha difference is reduced substantially for all size groups. For large-size stocks the difference reduces from
0.66 percent (p value .00) to 0.08 percent (p value  .70). Adding LMS also
reduces alpha for medium-size stocks. Alpha goes down from 1.31 percent
( p value .00) to –0.03 percent (p value  .58). In the small-size stocks, however, inclusion of LMS does not eliminate the signiﬁcance of alpha but alpha
is reduced from 2.05 percent ( p value .00) to 0.59 percent ( p value  .09).

CONCLUSION
Our empirical evidence shows that arbitrage risk explains the premium
bet ween high- and low-volume stocks. Our results confirm those of
Gervais, Kaniel, and Minglegrin (2001) who document the existence of a
high-volume premium. They are also consistent with the ﬁndings of Ang et
al. (2006) who show that U.S. stocks with high lagged idiosyncratic volatility
earn very low future average returns. Moreover, our arbitrage interpretation
of the visibility hypothesis complements Chan and Lakonishok (1993), who
suggest that buy decisions convey more information to the market than
sell decisions because the latter are typically liquidity motivated. That the
information effect on trading volume, however, is only part of the story.
Investors, who provide the liquidity to other investors with limited investment opportunity sets and who proﬁt from any price discrepancy between
market segments, care about the availability of perfect substitutes (arbitrage
risk). Their demand for such assets increases the visibility of those assets
and forces other investors to consider them. When assets with low arbitrage
risk are underpriced, increased visibilit y causes prices to increase and
expected returns to decrease. Overall, our results suggest that the visibility
and investor recognition related hypotheses should consider the arbitrage
risk of the underlying asset because a shock to trading activity may signal
possible price corrections.

The Impact of
Hard versus Soft
Information on
Trading Volume
Evidence from Management
Earnings Forecasts
Paul Brockman and Jim Cicon

ABSTRACT
We examine the impact of hard (quantitative) versus soft (qualitative)
information on trading volume around the release of management earnings
forecasts. We use textual analysis to identify and measure the level of two
soft information variables, Optimism and Certaint y, in each forecast.
We posit and conﬁrm that soft information has a signiﬁcant impact on
trading volume, even after controlling for the effect of hard information.
In fact, we show that soft information explains more of the trading volume
impact of management forecasts than hard information. Our empirical
results contribute to the growing literature that examines the economic
signiﬁcance of qualitative information.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, we investigate how the release of management earnings
forecasts impacts the announcing ﬁrm’s trading volume. Our main interest
is to differentiate the impact of hard, or quantitative, information from the
impact of soft, or qualitative, information. Since a typical management
forecast announcement contains roughly 99 words for every one number,
we expect that soft information (i.e., words instead of numbers) plays a
signiﬁcant role in providing relevant information to the market. The more
informative the announcement, all else equal, the more abnormal trading
volume the announcement will generate. We use textual analysis to identify
and measure the level of two speciﬁc soft information variables, Optimism
and Certainty, in each management forecast. Our empirical results conﬁrm
that soft information has a signiﬁcant impact on trading volume, even after
controlling for the effect of hard information. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd
that Optimism has a positive and signiﬁcant impact on abnormal trading
volume at the time of the forecast, while Certainty has a negative and
signiﬁcant impact on abnormal trading volume at the time of the forecast.
These results suggest that qualitative information associated with greater
optimism increases investors’ propensity to trade, while qualitative information associated with greater certaint y decreases their propensit y to
trade. In contrast, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant relation between abnormal trading
and quantitative information.
Our chapter is motivated by combining the management forecast
literature and the textual analysis literature. Previous studies show that
management earnings forecasts contain substantial value-relevant information (Hirst, Koonce, and Venkataraman, 2008). Pownall, Wasley, and
Waymire (1993) show that voluntary disclosures generate a signiﬁcant
price effect at the time of the announcement. The market reassesses the
ﬁrm’s prospects as a result of the voluntary disclosure and adjusts its price
accordingly. Coller and Yohn (1997) show that such announcements also
have a significant impact on firm liquidit y, and Baginski and Hassell
(1990) ﬁnd a signiﬁcant impact on analyst revisions. Recent research by
Aboody and Kasznik (2000), Cheng and Lo (2006), and Brockman,
Khurana, and Martin (2008) ﬁnds that managers exercise considerable
leeway in the timing and content of their voluntar y disclosures. For
our purposes, the combination of value-relevant information and considerable managerial discretion offers an ideal setting in which to examine

c h a p t e r 2 4 T h e I m pa c t o f I n f o r m at i o n o n T r a d i n g V o l u m e

qualitative versus quantitative information. While required financial
reports specify the form and content of disclosures, voluntary disclosures
(e.g., management earnings forecasts) are open-ended. Managers not only
choose whether or not to issue forecasts, they also choose the combination of hard and soft information contained in their announcements.
There is a growing literature in accounting and ﬁnance that uses textual
analysis to examine the soft information content of ﬁrm announcements
(e.g., Das and Chen, 2007; Tetlock, 2007; and Das, Martinez-Jerez, and
Tufano, 2005). Many, if not most, of these studies analyze the relation
between soft information and the ﬁrm’s reported earnings (e.g., Li, 2006;
Engelberg, 2007; Davis, Piger, and Sedor, 2007; Tetlock, Saar-Tsechansky,
Macskassy, 2008; Demers and Vega, 2008). Demers and Vega (2008), for
example, investigate the price effect of hard versus soft information using
more than 20,000 earnings announcements. Their results show that soft
information has a signiﬁcant impact on stock prices at the time of the
earnings announcement. Brockman and Cicon (2009) ﬁnd similar, afﬁrmative results for the role of soft information during the announcements of
more than 15,000 management earnings forecasts.
The rest of this chapter proceeds as follows: we describe our data and
methods of analysis in this chapter’s second section. We present and analyze
our empirical ﬁndings in the third section of this chapter, and then provide
a brief conclusion in the ﬁnal section.

DATA AND METHODOLOGY
Data
Our chapter analyzes the soft information found in the text of companyissued, guidance press releases. We use LexisNexis as the source of these
press releases. Specifically, we restrict our search to the LexisNexis
“Company Press Releases” database and further limit our search to the
following news providers: PR Newswire (US), Business Wire, and Canada
Newswire. Our timeframe is 1994 to 2007.
Our query analyzes the “subject” line and the “headline” of each candidate press release. Starting with the subject line, we keep only those press
releases which fall into the following categories: (“earnings preannouncements” or “earnings projections or forecasts”) and not (“interim ﬁnancial
results”). We exclude the “interim ﬁnancial results” hits because press

353

354

Pa rt V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

releases in this category tend to originate from noncompany sources (e.g.,
analyst commentary). We scan the headlines of the remaining documents
and retain only those that contain the following terms: (guidance OR
forecast OR predict OR prediction OR projection OR forward OR future
OR expect OR expected OR expectation OR update OR anticipate OR
reafﬁrm) AND ((cash W/S ﬂow) OR earn OR earning OR share OR stock
OR EPS OR fiscal OR price OR revenue OR results OR profit OR
proﬁtability OR targets OR growth OR raise OR lower OR upward OR
upwardly OR downward OR downwardly). The AND connector between
the two groups of words means that one of the ﬁrst group of words AND
one of the second group of words must appear in the headline in order for
the press release to be retained.
This LexisNexis search yields 74,603 candidate press releases, many of
which are duplicates and/or commentary by third parties subsequent to
the original press release. To ensure uniqueness and relevancy, we match
the candidate press releases with the First Call “Company Issued Guidelines” database. Since the 74,603 press releases downloaded from LexisNexis are in PDF format, they are not readily identiﬁable by a machine.
Therefore, we write custom software to scan and extract the ticker symbol and the announcement date from each press release. We retain only
those press releases which match the First Call ticker symbol and which
occur on the same day as the First Call guidance release. Where more
than one press release occurs on the same day for the same company, we
keep the earliest. We also discard press releases that do not contain at
least 100 words.
After these steps, we are left with 15,010 press releases. We randomly
sample t hese press releases to ensure uniqueness and relevancy.
We then run custom algorithms to clean up the press releases. We ﬁrst
remove all punctuation. Hyphenated words are concatenated. Numerical
terms are counted and then removed, with a record of their count
retained. If tables are found, they are removed, although we keep record
of their presence with a dummy variable. Words which do not occur more
than two times in a given document are discarded. We truncate press
releases which are longer than 750 words. This effectively removes
company-description and safe-harbor paragraphs in the longer press
releases. Shorter press releases do not typically contain these boilerplate
paragraphs.

Methodology
Our methodology analyzes each press release for the presence of semantic
features, speciﬁcally, for the presence of Optimism and Certainty. We base
our analysis on Diction, a language processing software package which
has been used extensively in prior research to analyze political and economic speeches, corporate reports, and earnings announcements. Diction
analyzes a document by counting the frequency of speciﬁc key words.
It compares these counts to norms calculated from a broad sample of
English text consisting of 20,000 documents drawn f rom political
speeches, newspaper editorials, business reports, scientiﬁc documents,
telephone conversations, etc.
Diction deﬁnes Net Optimism (equivalent to our term Optimism) as language endorsing some person, group, concept or event, or highlighting their
positive accomplishments (Carroll, 2000). The prog ram generates
an aggregate standardized score for Optimism by counting words in deﬁned
categories and combining the standardized scores for each category as shown
Optimism  (praise  satisfaction  inspiration)
 (blame  hardship  denial)

(24.1)

Diction deﬁnes Certainty as language indicating resoluteness, inﬂexibility,
completeness, and a tendency to speak ex cathedra. The program generates
an aggregate standardized score for Certainty by counting words in deﬁned
categories and combining the standardized scores for each category as shown
Certainty  (tenacity  leveling  collectives  numerical_terms)
 (ambivalence  self_reference  variety)

(24.2)

These two semantic features, Net Optimism and Certainty serve as the soft
information variables in our chapter.
In addition to standardizing our qualitative information variables using
Diction’s out-of-sample mean and variance values, we replicate all empirical
tests using in-sample mean and variance values. We ﬁnd no substantive
difference between either approach and conclude that our empirical results
and conclusions are not sensitive to the standardization procedure.

SUFE is the standardized unexpected earnings forecast. Optimism is “a
measure of language endorsing some person, group, concept or event, or
highlighting their positive entailments.” Certainty consists of words indicating resoluteness, inﬂexibility, and completeness. Market cap is the natural
logarithm of the ﬁrms’ market capitalization. Analyst coverage is the number
of analysts covering ﬁrm j in quarter t. Intangibility is intangible assets
divided by total assets. Standard deviation (SD) of returns is the standard
deviation of returns from 30 days to 7 days from the announcement
date. The sample period spans 1994 to 2007 and includes those ﬁrms which
appeared in the First Call company-issued, guidelines database and for
which a matching company press release was found in LexisNexis for a total
of 14,938 company-issued, guidance press releases.
Our dependent variable, ATV, is measure of abnormal trading volume
that compares trading volume around management guidance announcements with trading volume in the preannouncement period. ATV is deﬁned
as follows:

Our main treatment variables include a quantitative variable, SUFE, and
two qualitative variables, Optimism and Certainty. SUFE is the standardized
unexpected earnings forecast. We construct SUFE by subtracting the management earnings forecast of ﬁrm j for time period t from the ﬁrm’s actual
(reported) earnings in time period t  1. This difference is used as the
unexpected component in the manager’s forecast. Lastly, we calculate SUFE
by subtracting the sample mean and dividing by the sample standard deviation. Our ﬁrst qualitative variable, Optimism, is “a measure of language
endorsing some person, group, concept or event, or highlighting their positive entailments.” Our second qualitative variable, Certainty, consists of
words indicating resoluteness, inﬂexibility, and completeness.
Our control variables include market capitalization, analyst coverage,
intangibilit y, and standard deviation of returns. MktCap is the natural

357

358

Pa rt V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

logarithm of the ﬁrms’ market capitalization. Analyst coverage is the number
of analysts covering ﬁrm j in quarter t. Intangibility is intangible assets
divided by total assets. StdDevRet is the standard deviation of returns from
30 days to 7 days from the announcement date. Our sample period is
from 1994 to 2007. The sample includes those ﬁrms which appeared in the
First Call company-issued, guidelines database and for which a matching
company press release was found in LexisNexis for a total of 14,938
company-issued, guidance press releases.
We present our baseline regression results in Table 24.2. We estimate
the following regression:

 β5 Analysti  β6 Intangibilityi  β7 StdDevReti  εi

where all variables are deﬁned above. The sample period spans 1994 to 2007
and includes those ﬁrms which appeared in the First Call company-issued,
guidelines database and for which a matching company press release was
found in LexisNexis for a total of 14,938 company-issued, guidance press
releases. We control for industry effects, not shown. Our main variables of
interest are the treatment variables SUFE, Optimism, and Certainty. The
coefﬁcient on SUFE is negative and insigniﬁcant, suggesting that the unexpected component of guidance forecasts does not have a signiﬁcant impact
on trading volume. In contrast, the coefﬁcients for both qualitative variables
are signiﬁcant. The coefﬁcient on Optimism is positive and signiﬁcant.

This result means that the more optimistic the language contained in the
management guidance, the larger the increase in abnormal trading. The
coefﬁcient on Certainty is negative and signiﬁcant, suggesting that the more
certain the language contained in the management guidance, the smaller the
increase in abnormal trading. Overall, these ﬁndings show that trading
volume is very sensitive to soft information. All else equal, more optimist
language increases trading volume and more certain language decreases
trading volume.
The coefﬁcients on the control variables in regression in Equation (24.3)
show that abnormal trading increases with analyst coverage and decreases with
market capitalization, intangibility, and the standard deviation of returns.

SUFECertainty. These coefﬁcients allow us to test if there are signiﬁcant
interaction effects between hard and soft information (e.g., the full impact of
Optimism on ATV is composed of a direct effect (measured by β2) and an
indirect or interaction effect (measured by β4SUFE). The indirect effects
tell us if soft and hard information behave as complements or substitutes to
one another. Our results in Table 24.3 show that there are no signiﬁcant
interaction effects for either soft variable. Both interaction coefﬁcients are
positive but insigniﬁcant. This ﬁnding suggests that the impact of Optimism
and Certainty on abnormal trading volume is a direct effect; that is, the
impact is not dependent on the level of SUFE.
We examine additional interaction effects in Table 24.4. We estimate the
following four regressions with interaction terms for each of our control
variables (included one at a time):
ATVi  β0  β1 SUFEi  β2 Optimismi  β3 Certaintyi  β4 ControlVari *
Optimismi  β5 ControlVari * Certaintyi β6 MktCapi  β7 Analysti 

where all variables are deﬁned above, and the term ControlVar stands for either
MktCap, Analyst, Intangibility, or StdDevRet, depending on the regression.
The sample period spans 1994 to 2007 and includes those ﬁrms which
appeared in the First Call company-issued, guidelines database and for which a
matching company press release was found in LexisNexis for a total of 14,938
company-issued, guidance press releases. We control for industry effects, not
shown. We report the results of interacting MktCap with our soft information
variables in Panel A. The interaction between Optimism and MktCap is negative and insigniﬁcant, while the interaction between Certainty and MktCap is
positive and signiﬁcant. This latter result suggests that Certainty has a larger
impact on the trading volume of large ﬁrms than small ﬁrms. We ﬁnd a similar interaction effect between Certainty and Intangibility in Panel C. That is,
the interaction between Optimism and Intangibility is negative and insigniﬁcant, while the interaction between Certainty and Intangibility is positive and
signiﬁcant. Certainty has a larger impact on the trading volume of ﬁrms with
more intangible assets. In contrast, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant interaction effects
for Analyst Coverage and StDevRet in Panels B and D, respectively.

CONCLUSION
The primary objective of this chapter is to examine the impact of hard
(quantitative) versus soft (qualitative) information on trading volume
around the release of management earnings forecasts. Our chapter is motivated by the growing literature that links soft information to market reactions, as well as previous studies showing that management forecasts
contain value-relevant information. We use textual analysis to identify and
measure the level of t wo soft information variables, Optimis m and
Certainty. We hypothesize that these soft information variables will have a

361

362

signiﬁcant impact on trading volume at the time of earnings guidance
announcements. Our empirical results conﬁrm this hypothesis. We ﬁnd a
positive and signiﬁcant relation between abnormal trading volume and
Optimism, and a negative and signiﬁcant relation between abnormal trading
volume and Certainty. In contrast, we do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relation
between abnormal trading volume and our measure of hard information,
the standardized unexpected earnings forecast. Overall, our chapter contributes to the growing literature that examines the economic signiﬁcance
of qualitative information.

Modeling Bubbles
and Anti-Bubbles
in Bear Markets
A Medium-Term Trading Analysis
Dean Fantazzini

ABSTRACT
The current volatile market situation with sudden changes seems all but
predictable. However, some recent works have suggested that, prior to
crashes as well as after crashes, ﬁnancial asset prices can be characterized by
a power law acceleration decorated with log-periodic oscillations. Johansen
and Sornette (1999) and Zhou and Sornette (2005) show that these processes take place because of the traders’ herding behavior which can progressively occur and strengthen itself into “bullish” or “bearish” market
phases, thus forming bubbles and anti-bubbles, respectively. We brieﬂy
review the theory behind this kind of modeling and we perform an empirical analysis with different world stock market indexes to verify whether a
medium-term trading strategy based on this modeling can outperform simple buy-and-hold or short-and-hold strategies.

INTRODUCTION
The current global ﬁnancial crisis which began in 2007 has probably become
one of the most interesting examples of how the bursting of a bubble can be
dealt with by creating new bubbles. While this consideration may be seen at

365

ﬁrst a little bit strong (but not new; see, e.g., Sornette and Woodard, 2009,
and references therein), it has been recently conﬁrmed by Lou Jiwei, the
chairman of the $298 billion sovereign wealth fund named China Investment Corporation (CIC). This fund was created in 2007 for managing part
of the People’s Republic of China’s foreign exchange reserves, with the speciﬁc goal to generate higher returns through advanced asset management
techniques. On August 28, 2009, Lou told reporters on the sidelines of a
forum organized by the Washington-based Brookings Institution and the
Chinese Economists 50 Forum, a Beijing think tank, that “both China and
America are addressing bubbles by creating more bubbles and we’re just
taking advantage of that. So we can’t lose.” Moreover, asked whether CIC
would be a keen buyer in the United States, Lou said, “CIC can buy
anywhere in the world, but it cannot avoid buying U.S. assets because the
U.S. economy and capital markets are so large.” Besides, Lou added that
“CIC was building a broad investment portfolio that includes products
designed to generate both alpha and beta; to hedge against both inﬂation and
deﬂation; and to provide guaranteed returns in the event of a new crisis.”
See the full Reuters article by Zhou Xin and Alan Wheatley (2009) at
http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE57S0D420090829 for more
details. Clearly, the previous comments highlight how important is to have
an appropriate model for bubbles and so-called anti-bubbles, which refer to
the period following the burst of a bubble.
A model which has quickly gained a lot of attention among practitioners
and academics due to many successful predictions is the so-called log periodic po wer law (LPPL) model proposed by Sornette, Johansen, and
Bouchaud (1996), Sornette and Johansen (1997), Johansen, Ledoit, and
Sornette (2000), and Sornette (2003). These authors suggested that, prior
to crashes, the mean function of an index price time-series is characterized
by a power law acceleration decorated with log-periodic oscillations, leading
to a ﬁnite-time singularity that describes the onset of the market crash.
Within this model, this behavior would hold for months and years in
advance, allowing the anticipation of the crash from the log-periodic oscillations exhibited by the prices. The underlying hypothesis of this model is
the existence of a growing cooperative action of the market traders due to
an imitative behavior among them. Particularly, Johansen, Ledoit, and
Sornette (2000) put forward the idea that stock market crashes are caused
by the slow build up of long-range correlations leading to a collapse of the

c h a p t e r 2 5 MODE LING B U B B LES A ND A NTI - B U B B LES IN B E A R M A R K ETS

stock market in one critical instant. For a recent review of the theoretical
framework of the log-periodic model and a compilation of empirical
evidences, see Sornette (2003). Johansen and Sornette (1999) and Zhou and
Sornette (2005) addressed the problem of whether there exist critical times
tc at which the market peaks and then follows a power law decrease with
decelerating log-periodic oscillations; in the latter case we have a so called
anti-bubble. Johansen and Sornette (1999) and Zhou and Sornette (2005)
showed that the traders’ herding behavior can progressively occur and
strengthen itself also in “bearish” decreasing market phases, thus forming
anti-bubbles with decelerating market devaluations following market peaks.
What we do in this chapter is to brieﬂy review the theory behind this
kind of modeling and perform an empirical analysis with different world
stock market indexes to verify whether a medium-term trading strategy
based on this modeling can outperform simple buy-and-hold or short-andhold strategies.
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. In the second section of
this chapter, we review the log-periodic models for bubble and anti-bubble
modeling, and in the third section we show an empirical application with
world stock market indexes. We perform an out-of-sample analysis in this
chapter’s fourth section, and the ﬁfth section brieﬂy concludes.

LOG-PERIODIC MODELS: A REVIEW
Johansen, Ledoit, and Sornette (2000) considered an ideal market in a scenario purely speculative that does not pay dividends. For simplicity, interest rates, risk aversion, and market liquidity constraints are ignored. In
this scenario, there is at least a rational agent, risk neutral and with
rational expectations. Given these assumptions, the price at time t, p(t), of
ﬁnancial assets should follow a martingale stochastic process. If we consider that there is a nonzero probability of a crash taking place, formally,
we can deﬁne a counter function for the occurrence of the crash, given by
a step function j(t)  Ω(t–tc) whose value is zero before the crash and one
after the occurrence of the crash at the time tc. Since tc is unknown, it is
described by a stochastic variable subject to a probability density function
q(t) and a cumulative distribution function Q(t) 兰 q(t′)dt′. If we deﬁne
the hazard rate h(t) as the probability per unit of time of the crash taking
place in the next instant, given that it has not yet occurred, that is

367

368

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

h(t)  q(t)/[1 – Q(t)], then the martingale condition implies that the
expected price rise must be just sufﬁcient to compensate for the known
risk of a crash. As a consequence, the dynamics of the price is given by
dp  k p(t) h(t) dt

(25.1)

where dp is the price change over the time interval dt, while k ∈ (0,1) is the
ﬁxed proportion by which the price is expected to drop, and we remark that
all the terms on the right hand side of Equation (25.1) are positive. If we
reorder the previous equation, we have dp/p(t)  k h(t) dt, and after integrating we get
t
⎞
⎛ t
ln p( t ) = k ∫ h( t ′) dt ′ or p( t ) = p( t 0 )exp ⎜⎜ k ∫ h( t ′) dt ′⎟⎟
t0
⎠
⎝ t0

(25.2)

Equation (25.2) shows an interesting result: the higher the probability of
a crash (given it has not yet taken place), the faster the price growth has to
be. Intuitively, investors must be compensated with higher returns for the
risk of higher losses. The signiﬁcant deviation of prices in relation to its
fundamental value for long periods of time is an issue still being debated in
financial literature and in particular has been examined by Blanchard
(1979), who introduced a model for bubble with rational expectations.
This effect is not particular to the speciﬁc dynamics described by Equation (25.2). If we alternatively assume that during the crash the price drops a
ﬁxed percentage k ∈ (0,1) of the speculative price increase in relation to a certain
fundamental value p*, then the dynamics of the price before the of the crash
is given by
dp  k [p(t) – p*] h(t) dt

(25.3)

If we integrate Equation (25.3) and assume that p(t) – p(t0)  p(t0) – p*,
we have
t

t0

p( t ) = p( t 0 ) + k ∫ ( p( t ′) − p *)h( t ′)dt ′ = p( t 0 ) + k( p( t 0 ) − p *) k ∫ h( t ′) dt ′

(25.4)

c h a p t e r 2 5 MODE LING B U B B LES A ND A NTI - B U B B LES IN B E A R M A R K ETS

The model therefore does not impose any constraint on the dimension of
the crash: if we assume that it is proportional to the current market price,
then we have to deal with the natural logarithm of prices, as shown by
Equation (25.1) and Equation (25.2). Instead, if we assume that the amplitude of the crash is a fraction of the gain observed during the bubble, then
the variable to consider is the price in levels, according to Equation (25.3)
and Equation (25.4). In both cases, conditionally on staying in a bubble
with no crash occurrence, the asset price should grow rationally to compensate buyers for taking the risk of a market crash.
However, it is important to remark that there is a small probability that
the system, starting from time t, will reach the end of the bubble without
the occurrence of a crash
tc

1− ∫ h( t ) dt

(25.5)

t

This residual probabilit y is crucial for the consistency of the model
because, otherwise, the agents would anticipate the crash and quit the market.
According to Equation (25.2) or Equation (25.4), the temporal evolution
of prices during the bubble depends on the hazard rate h(t), whose determination is developed by using models coming from statistical physics.
Johansen, Ledoit, and Sornette (2000) propose a model where each
trader i can be in one of two states, either bull (si  1) or bear (si 1),
while at the next time step the state of trader is determined by the following
formula:
⎛
⎞
s i = sign ⎜⎜ K ∑ s j + σε i ⎟⎟
⎝ j∈N ( i )
⎠

(25.6)

where K is an imitation factor, N(i) is the group of neighboring traders who
inﬂuence trader i, σ is the tendency towards idiosyncratic behavior amongst
all traders, whereas εi is a random draw from a standard normal distribution. Moreover, they assume that during a bubble the value of K increases
until it reaches a critical value Kc, and this increase is developed such that
Kc – K(t) depends on the time span tc – t. As a consequence, the hazard rate
h varies in the same way as K /Kc.

369

370

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

By using these assumptions, Johansen, Ledoit, and Sornette (2000) show
that the hazard rate follows the following dynamics (the meaning of the
parameters will be deﬁned following Equation (25.10)):
h(t) ≈ B′(tc – t)α [1  C′cos(ω ln (tc – t)  φ′]

(25.7)

If we substitute the previous expression Equation (25.7) in Equation (25.2),
t

ln p( t ) = k ∫ B′( t c − t ′)−α [1 + C ′ cos(ω ln ( t c − t ′) + φ ′]dt ′

(25.8)

and then substitute β  1  α and ψ (t)  ω ln(tc  t)  φ′ in the integral,
we get

dt =

(25.9)

Finally, if we integrate Equation (25.8) by using Equation (25.9) and we
perform the following change of variables, A  ln p(tc), B  k B′ /β, C 
β 2C′ /(ω 2  β 2), we obtain the famous LPPL equation used by Sornette and
his co-authors in many works.
ln p(t) ≈ A  B(tc  t)β [1  C cos(ω ln (tc  t)  φ]

(25.10)

where t  tc is any time before the bubble, A  0 is the value of ln p(tc) at
the critical time, B  0 the increase in ln p(t) over the time unit before the
crash if C were to be close to zero, C 0 is the proportional magnitude of
the oscillations around the exponential growth, β should be positive to
ensure a ﬁnite price at the critical time tc of the bubble and quantiﬁes the
primary power law acceleration of prices, tc  0 is the critical time, ω is the
frequency of the oscillations during the bubble, while 0 φ 2π is a phase
parameter.

c h a p t e r 2 5 MODE LING B U B B LES A ND A NTI - B U B B LES IN B E A R M A R K ETS

A similar procedure can be followed in case of Equation (25.4) and
we would obtain an Equation very close to Equation (25.10), with the
only difference being the dependent variable given by the price in levels
instead of the log price. The two crucial parameters in this speciﬁcation
are β and ω; Johansen, Ledoit, and Sornette (2000), Sornette (2003), and
references therein show that for the underlying mechanism to be validated
β should be included in 0  β  1, while 4  ω  15. By using a large
collection of empirical evidence they found that β  0.33  0.18, while ω
 6.36  1.56.
However, we want to remark that even though the speciﬁc underlying
theoretical mechanism is not always validated (for example, it is not unusual to ﬁnd β  1), the LPPL with suitable parameters can provide a
good ﬁt to the examined bubble and help forecasting its future development. For more discussion about these issues as well as recent criticism, we
refer the interested reader to Chang and Feigenbaum (2006) and Lin Ren,
and Sornette (2010).
Johansen and Sornette (1999) and Zhou and Sornette (2005) examined
the problem of whether the cooperative herding behavior of traders might
also produce market evolutions that are symmetric to the accelerating speculative bubbles often ending in crashes. They show that there seems to exist
critical times tc at which the market peaks and then decreases following a
power law with decelerating log-periodic oscillations; in the latter case we
have a so called anti-bubble. Therefore, given this symmetric nature of
anti-bubbles, a straightforward way to model them is by simply inverting
the term (tc  t) in Equation (25.10).
ln p(t) ≈ A  B(t  tc) β [1  C cos(ω ln (t  tc)  φ]

(25.11)

p(t) ≈ A  B(t  tc)β [1  C cos(ω ln (t  tc)  φ]

(25.12)

if we use log prices or if we use price in levels, instead. Clearly, in the
latter case the values of the parameters A, B, C will be much different
with respect to the corresponding ones obtained with Equation (25.11),
while the parameters β, ω, and ϕ should have similar values in both the
two speciﬁcations.
Due to space limits, we do not discuss here about model estimation: we
only remark that even though Equations (25.10), (25.11), and (25.12) can

371

372

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

be estimated by nonlinear least squares, these formula are highly nonlinear
and local maxima are very easy to ﬁnd. Therefore, Johansen, Ledoit, and
Sornette (2000) proposed a multistep procedure involving grid searches
as well as the use of the Nelder-Mead simplex search. The estimation of
such models is not an easy task and the author of this chapter has used a
new alternative method which seems to be very promising, but still needs
more beta-testing and future work. We leave this as avenue for future
research. Anyway, some computational tips will be described in the next
section.

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS WITH WORLD
STOCK MARKET INDEXES
We report below the in-sample estimation results for Equations (25.11)
and (25.12) for the most important world stock market indexes (the time
t is converted in units of one year, 1/365  0.002739. . .). We found that
estimating LPPL for anti-bubbles was much easier when using a singledigit time variable t, for example “9”, instead of a triple-digit variable
“2009.” Furthermore, estimating models with log-prices was much
simpler than models with prince in levels: in the latter case a more careful choice of the starting values has to be made. Interestingly, we noticed
that if a time series was clearly NOT following a LPPL anti-bubble pattern,
then the model using prices in levels was never able to reach numerical
convergence, even after a careful choice of starting values. Instead, the
model using log-prices always converged but with the parameters β  1
and ω  4.
To increase estimation efﬁciency and to reduce the parameter space, we
used here for the ﬁrst time the following computational solution: differently from bubbles, when we work with anti-bubbles we do know the date of
the global maxima as well as the corresponding price. As a consequence,
the parameter tc need not be estimated and can be ﬁxed a priori. The same
solution can be implemented for A, but we found it less crucial, from a
numerical point of view, than fixing t c. The estimated parameters for
the model with log-prices in Equation (25.11) and prices in levels in
Equation (25.12), as well as the ﬁtted series are reported below for each
stock market index.

Comments on Anti-bubble Empirical Results
The previous analysis highlights some interesting results: the log-periodic
model 25.11, which considers log-prices reached numerical convergence in
almost all cases, but at the same time the parameter β was almost always
greater than 1, thus invalidating the underlying theoretical mechanism.
Instead, the model which makes use of the prices in levels almost always
showed values of β included between 0 and 1, and similarly 4  ω  15
(except for the U.S. markets; see discussion below); therefore, our analysis
seems to support the assumption that the speculative price decreases in
relation to a certain fundamental value p*; see Equations (25.3) and (25.4).
Moreover, when the model using price in levels did not converge, such as
for the Chinese, Russian, and Brazilian markets, it is clear by looking at the
market plots that we are not in front of a possible anti-bubble structure; see
Figures 25.4 and 25.5.
Interestingly, the markets which most beneﬁted from state intervention,
like the U.S., Russian, and Chinese markets, are the ones for which the estimated coefﬁcient β was greater than 1, or for which the log-periodic model
(in price levels) did not converge. We remind that β is the parameter governing the bubble growth and should be positive to ensure a ﬁnite price at
the critical time tc of the anti-bubble. In this regard, Zhou and Sornette
(2005) highlighted that the cumulative effect of strong exogenous shocks,
such as the U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate and monetary policies can
progressively detune the anti-bubble pattern; this seems exactly what has
happened with the U.S., Russian, and Chinese markets, where the massive
injections of liquidity in the market has strongly modiﬁed the log-periodic

379

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

structure. However, did these huge money injections ﬁnish to build up new
market bubbles?

Bubbles in Bear Markets
Bastiaensen et al. (2009) were the ﬁrst to analyze the bubble nature of the
market growth in the SSE Composite Index in July 2009, a month in
advance of the subsequent crash. They noted that “the Shanghai Composite
is the best performing large stock market in 2009 and is up 65 percent for
the year, and rising. To reach a targeted GDP growth of 8 percent, Chinese
policy has turned to a bank model of massive lending, which has provided
China with sufﬁcient liquidity to fuel this bubble.” Moreover, they predicted that “the Shanghai Composite Index will reach a critical level around
July 17–27, 2009.” The market peaked on August 4, 2009, and then lost 20
percent in two weeks.
We repeat the previous analysis with a new computational methodology
still under development (as previously anticipated) but very promising, and
we consider also the case for the U.S. S&P 500 in August 2009, for the
Russian RTS market in May 2009, and the S&P 500 in July 2007 for sake
of comparison, being that the peak of the market in the decade. The
in-sample results for the model given by Equation (25.10), computed using
data spanning from the global minima until one day before the market
peak, are reported in Table 25.11.
Not surprisingly, all four markets show very similar estimated parameters, particularly with respect to the key coefﬁcients β and ω. Besides, we

want to propose here a graphical tool that we found extremely useful to
track the development of a bubble and to understand if a possible crash is in
sight, or at least a bubble deﬂation: we plot on the horizontal axis the date of
the last observation in the estimation sample, and on the vertical axis the forecasted crash date t̂c. If a change in the stock market regime is approaching,
the (recursively) estimated t̂c should stabilize around a constant value close
to the turning point. We called such a plot the crash lock-in plot (CLIP).
We report in Figure 25.6 the CLIPs for the previous four cases.

OUT-OF-SAMPLE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
We now examine the out-of-sample performances of the anti-bubble models
and compare them with simple buy-and-hold and short-and-hold strategies.

381

382

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

We consider two possible ways to employ the previous log-periodic models
25.11 and 25.12:
• STRATEGY A: Estimate the model once and then buy or
short the underlying market index depending on the forecasted
path: a forecasted positive slope imply a buy (long) position, while a
negative slope a sell (short) position. We consider as possible
length for the initialization sample the following cases: 25, 50,
100, 200 days.
• STRATEGY B: Re-estimate recursively the model every h days,
compute the corresponding h-step-ahead forecast, and rebalance the
portfolio accordingly: if the h-step-ahead forecast is higher than the current
price, open a long position, and if it is lower open a short position. We
consider here only the market where both log-periodic models
converged, and the U.S. markets, too, even though we remark that
their estimated coefﬁcients β were slightly greater than 1, thus
representing a sort of borderline case. We consider the following
possible values for h: 25, 50, 100 days.
Due to space limits we report below the results only for two indexes:
DAX, SP500.
As it is possible to observe by looking at Tables 25.12 to 25.15, logperiodic models can outperform not only the simple buy-and-hold strateg y (which is easy, given that we are in a bear market), but also the
short-and-hold strateg y, with better ret urns with basically the same
(daily) risk measures. We also note that model 25.12 which uses prices in
levels sometimes delivers higher returns than the model in log-prices
25.11; however, this result depends crucially on the length of the initialization sample used and model 25.12 is usually more difﬁcult to estimate
than model 25.11. Furthermore, there seems to be an optimal length for
the initialization sample (for strategy A) and the forecasting step h (for
strategy B); approximately 100 days for the initialization sample if strategy A is employed; instead, if strategy B is chosen, the optimal time
length h to rebalance the portfolio is usually between 25 and 50 days.
Moreover, strategy B outperforms the short-and-hold strategy more frequently than strategy A (these results are also conﬁrmed by the stock
market indexes not reported here for sake of space).

CONCLUSION
We reviewed the theory of log-periodic models for bubble and anti-bubble
modeling and we performed an empirical analysis with different world stock
market indexes to verify whether a medium-term trading strategy based on
these models can outperform simple buy-and-hold or short-and-hold strategies. We found that these models can outperform both the buy-and-hold
strategy (easy) and the short-and-hold strategy, but this result depends crucially on the initialization sample and/or the frequency for portfolio rebalancing, where the latter is usually between 25 and 50 days.

Strategic Financial
Intermediaries with
Brokerage Activities
Laurent Germain, Fabrice Rousseau,
and Anne Vanhems

ABSTRACT
In this chapter, we study the strategic use by banks of their brokerage
activities. We consider a situation where N competing banks are engaged
in brokerage activities and have access to private information about the liquidation value of a risky asset. Selling brokerage activities, banks collect
orders from their clients and can use their brokerage divisions to enhance
their own proﬁts. This order ﬂow is considered in our model as uninformative, i.e., as being noise. The banks’ ability to observe part of the total
order ﬂow, i.e., its own volume and the one of its clients, even though it
does not incorporate any private information, gives valuable information
concerning the level of noise trading in the market. We show that taking
advantage of that information, i.e., the strategic use of their brokerage
activities, increases the banks’ expected proﬁts. However, we prove that
the aggregate expected proﬁt is lower when banks strategically use their
brokerage activities.

INTRODUCTION
Investment banks and ﬁnancial institutions invest in the collection and the
production of information; in particular, they possess their own research
divisions. One of the uses of this information is proprietary trading whereby
banks trade for their own account. Nevertheless, ﬁnancial institutions
may have other sources of information. They can infer private information
from their clients. Indeed, some banks may know that some of their clients
have private information and infer that private information from their
clients’ trading. Moreover, as ﬁnancial institutions can also act as brokers
and transmit noninformative orders on behalf of their customers, they are
also able to infer part of the total order ﬂow observed by market makers.
This duality in the role of banks that on the one hand act as traders and on
the other hand act as brokers can induce a conﬂict of interest between the
clients and the ﬁnancial institutions as the banks could use their clients’
information strategically.
Empirical evidence in Michaely and Womack (1999) shows a particular
conﬂict of interest faced by investment banks. On the one hand, they have
incentives to transmit reliable information to their customers to maintain
their reputation. On the other hand, they can use this information for
serving their own interests and distort it. Some ﬁnancial scandals in the
United States have highlighted this type of conﬂict of interest for the use
of the information by banks. Indeed, the banks’ ﬁnancial analysts who
gather information can release false information to the market to serve the
banks’ or their clients’ ﬁnancial interests.
This raises the following issues. What are the consequences of such
leakages in the Chinese walls of ﬁnancial institutions? Should brokerage
activities be banned for ﬁnancial institutions which develop their own
trading divisions?
We develop a model where ﬁnancial institutions produce information,
trade for their own account, and observe their clients’ orders in the frame
of their brokerage activities. We assume that the banks’ customers do not
possess private information and are, therefore, considered to be noise traders. Small customers using the banks to transmit their orders to the market
are not reputed to be informed. The customer’s order ﬂow is then pure
noise and does not contain any private information. Given these brokerage
activities, banks have access to some valuable information concerning part

c h a p t e r 2 6 ST R ATE G IC F IN A N C I A L IN TER M EDI A R I ES

of the liquidity trading in the market stemming from their customers.
When engaging in proprietary trading, banks can use this knowledge to
their beneﬁt.
This chapter is close to the models of Fishman and Longstaff (1992),
Roell (1990), and Sarkar (1995) who study dual trading for brokerage
ﬁrms. The main difference between these models and our work is that, in
the present model the financial instit utions also trade for their own
account. In Fishman and Longstaff (1992), the brokers bear a ﬁxed cost of
maintaining a brokerage business and a variable cost for ﬁlling an order.
Under such a framework, the authors derive the competitive commission
for ﬁlling orders. Nevertheless, Fishman and Longstaff (1992) do not
model the competition bet ween broker houses in the market. In our
model, banks compete in the ﬁnancial market when trading and face the
same cost structure.
Biais and Germain (2002) and Germain (2005) study the conﬂict of
interest between ﬁnancial institutions that trade for their own account and
at the same time set up a fund for their clients. They derive the optimal
contracts that solve this conﬂict of interest. In particular, Germain (2005)
shows that at the equilibrium the banks can commit to add an optimal level
of noise to diminish their competition. In our model, we do not study what
would be the optimal contract but derive the optimal trading strategy for
ﬁnancial intermediaries. Brennan and Chordia (1993) analyze the case
where banks undertake brokerage activities. They st udy the optimal
brokerage schedule for the case where the broker sells information to the
customers. We do not address the question of selling information but focus
on the critical issue of free riding on information derived by the order ﬂow
transmitted by the customers.
Rochet and Vila (1994) study the case of a monopolistic trader who
observes the noise trading. In our chapter, we consider the case of N banks.
However, we restrict our analysis to a linear/normal model which is not the
case in the Rochet and Vila (1994) paper. We assume that the banks are strategic, informed, and have heterogeneous beliefs, for such a framework we derive
the following results. At the equilibrium, the ﬁnancial institutions that observe
some noise trading behave optimally by trading in the opposite direction of
their customers’ orders. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the liquidity and the banks’
responsiveness to private information are reduced. We show that the expected
proﬁt of a bank that observes part of the noise trading is always greater than

391

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

the proﬁt she would get otherwise. In addition, we also show that if part of the
liquidity order ﬂow is observed the aggregate expected proﬁt is reduced.
The chapter is organized as follows. In the next section, we study the case
where informed traders do not observe any noise from their customers.
In the third section of this chapter, we analyze the general case where some
noise can be observed. In the last section we conclude. All proofs are
gathered in the chapter’s Appendix.

THE BENCHMARK MODEL: NO NOISE IS
OBSERVED
This model is identical to Didri and Germain (2009), hereafter DG (2009).

Consider a ﬁnancial market with a risky asset whose ﬁnal value V is
normally distributed with zero mean and variance σ2v. There are three
types of agents:
• N risk neutral informed traders who observe a signal Si concerning
the future value of the asset before trading, such that

In the next section, we analyze the case where some of the noise trading
is observed by ﬁnancial institutions.

THE GENERAL MODEL: WHEN SOME
NOISE IS OBSERVED
Our objective is to study how a better knowledge of the noise trader order
ﬂow will affect the proﬁt of the agents.
In order to distinguish between observed and unobserved liquidit y
trading, we decompose the global order U into two parts U  U0  Uun,
where U 0 represents the obser ved liquidit y trading (decomposed in
subparts corresponding to the N informed traders) and Uun the unobserved
N
part. The observed part Uo  Σ Uio is itself decomposed into N subparts
i1
corresponding to the N informed traders: each informed trader i can
observe the liquidity order Uio. This decomposition of the total variance of
the liquidity trading will prove useful when studying the impact of observing some of this liquidity trading by informed traders.
2
2
We assume that: U0 → N(0, θσ U), Uun → N(0,(1  θ)σ U) with 0 θ 1,
N
2
and, i1,…, N, Uio → N(0αiσ U), with i1,…, N, 0 αi 1 and Σ α i  1.
i1
The parameters θ and α1,…, αN capture the impact of observing noise
trading. This can be understood as follows. Assume that the liquidit y
traders who want to trade Uio , do not submit this order directly to the
market but instead direct bank i to do it on their behalf. As this bank
trades for her own account, she might use this piece of information (size
of her clients order) when deciding the quantity to trade. The parameter
αi can be understood as the fraction of the overall observed noise trading
observed by agent i, in other words, this corresponds to the particular
banks’ brokerage activity. When, αi  0, this implies that Uio  0 in that
case agent i does not observe any of the noise trading order ﬂow. The
parameter θ corresponds to the overall brokerage activity in the market.
To summarize, we can consider the following different situations:
• θ  0: No noise is observed (no brokerage activity). This setting is
identical to DG (2009).
• θ  0: Part of the noise is observed. If, θ  1, there is no unobserved
liquidity order ﬂow. In that case all the customers’ orders are
channeled to the market by the banks. When i  1, … , N,αi  0,
all informed traders observe part of the liquidity trading. If for one
bank i we have that αi  0, then at least one ﬁnancial institution does

c h a p t e r 2 6 ST R ATE G IC F IN A N C I A L IN TER M EDI A R I ES

not observe any liquidity order. On the contrary, if for bank i αi  1
and θ  1, then that bank observes all the liquidity order ﬂow.
~
Assume that V , ε1,…,εN, U01,…,U0N, Uun are mutually independent.
A strategy for the informed agent i is a function Xi corresponding to his
market order and depending on Si and on the amount of liquidity trading
observed if any is observed. Given the informed market orders and the liquidity
N
order ﬂow, the aggregate order ﬂow is equal to W  Σ X i  U. Let P denote
i1
the equilibrium price determined by the market makers and πi  (V  P)Xi the
resulting trading proﬁt of insider i. As before, due to competition in market
making, the price must be such that E(V  P|W)  0. Each informed agent i
chooses Xi to maximize her expected proﬁt E(πi |Si, U01). We now derive the
unique perfect Bayesian linear equilibrium of this game.

Proof: See Appendix.

Interpretation of the Equilibrium
The strategy of bank i depends explicitly on the part of the order ﬂow
U io that she observes. Half of the observed order ﬂow is revealed by her
market order. This reduces the “amount” of noise in the aggregate order
f low. As a result market makers price more aggressively leading to a
decrease in market’s liquidity. It is then optimal for the banks to scale down
the size of their market order to reduce their impact on the price. Banks are
then revealing less of their private information. Moreover, one can see that
the bank i’s responsiveness to private information does not depend on the
particular fraction of the order ﬂow observed by bank i, αi. It only depends
on the overall fraction of the order ﬂow observed, θ. The more of the order
ﬂow is channeled to the market by banks, the more banks scale down their
trading.

Interpretation of the Individual Proﬁt
• The individual expected proﬁt for bank i is the sum of two terms: the
ﬁrst one corresponds to the individual expected proﬁt with no noise
multiplied by 1 − 43 θ and the second one depends explicitly on α i.
The former term takes into account the effect of the observation
of a fraction θ of the entire liquidity order ﬂow, i.e., on the overall
brokerage activity in the market. It affects all the banks whether they
undertake brokerage activities or not. The latter term embodies the
impact for bank i of her own brokerage activity which gives her the
observation of part of the noise trading α iθ.
• The ﬁrst term decreases with θ. As the fraction of the observed noise
trading increases, banks decrease their trading intensity and liquidity

c h a p t e r 2 6 ST R ATE G IC F IN A N C I A L IN TER M EDI A R I ES

decreases. This leads to a decrease in the individual expected proﬁt
of the banks. This term captures the negative effect of brokerage
activities in the market. The second term increases with both θ and
αi. In other words, the more bank i observes of the liquidity order
ﬂow the larger her expected proﬁt.
• The bank undertaking brokerage activities earns an expected proﬁt
larger than that of a bank that cannot observe any noise. The more
noise is observed by bank i, through an increase of αi, the less the
other banks earn in expectation.

Interpretation of the Aggregate Proﬁt
• When θ  0, we ﬁnd the results obtained in DG (2009).
• The impact of brokerage on aggregate proﬁt is given by the
multiplicative term A(θ ) =

2−θ
2 1 − 43 θ

, which is always less or equal to 1.

In particular, we have A(0)  A(1)  1 . The aggregate expected
proﬁt when no noise is observed is the same as when all the noise is
observed. Moreover, when some noise is observed, the aggregate
expected proﬁt diminishes. However, it decreases for 0 θ 2/3 and
increases for 2/3 θ 1.

Particular Case: All the Noise Trading Is Observed (θ  1)
In the case where θ  1, all the customers’ order ﬂow is directed to the market by the ﬁnancial institutions.
• The aggregate proﬁt is the same as when no noise is observed.
• The expected proﬁt of trader i is equal to i  1,…, N,

• The banks reveal half of the liquidity trading observed. If we
compare that with Proposition 1, we ﬁnd that banks reduce their
trading intensity by half. The market liquidity is also reduced by half.
• The individual expected proﬁt is increasing with the proportion of the
noise observed by the particular bank. However, if the entire noise is
observed, the aggregate expected proﬁt is not affected and is equal to
the one in the DG (2009) model.

CONCLUSION
In this model we analyze the case where ﬁnancial institutions sell brokerage
activities and trade for their own account. We show that the banks
optimally incorporate half of the noise trading observed, due to their
brokerage activities, and decrease their information responsiveness as well.
When analyzing both the banks’ individual expected proﬁt and the aggregate expected proﬁt, the following results are obtained. For each ﬁnancial
institution the expected proﬁt is increasing with the noise observed or her
amount of brokerage activities. This implies that if a bank does not engage
in brokerage activities her expected proﬁt is smaller than if she does. The
aggregate proﬁt when some of the order ﬂow is channeled to the market by
banks is always lower than the aggregate proﬁt in DG (2009), where no
noise is observed. However, for the extreme case where all the noise trading
order ﬂow is directed to the market by banks, the aggregate expected proﬁt
is equal to the one in DG (2009). In a different paper, we generalize this
approach to the case where the banks trade for their account, sell brokerage
activities, and sell information to their clients.

André F. Gygax

ABSTRACT
Over the past four decades trading volumes in most ﬁnancial markets have
steadily increased. This paper investigates the motivations for trading
using fundamental analysis, arbitrage and technical analysis. It is argued
that the large trading volumes in primary markets could be a consequence
of the automation of the trading process, the growth of electronic trading
and the emergence of hig-frequency trading strategies. Similarly, increased
levels of investor sophistication and the involvement of ﬁnancial specialists
with technical backgrounds have led to many ﬁnancial innovations in secondary or derivatives markets. Although trading volumes in option markets and many futures markets are high, U.S. single stock futures (SSFs)
volumes are low when compared to the trading volume in the underlying
equity securities and corresponding options contracts. This is surprising as
SSFs can be utilized as a cost effective technique to hedge and rebalance
portfolio positions.

INTRODUCTION
Most ﬁnancial markets have undergone a rapid evolution over the past four
decades. Many of the changes have coincided with seminal developments in
ﬁnancial economics, such as the pricing of options, the pricing of debt,
and arbitrage pricing (Black and Scholes, 1973; Merton, 1974; Ross, 1976).
This extent of the evolution of ﬁnancial markets, however, would not have
been possible without signiﬁcant advances in the underlying technology of
computing and the advancement of the Internet and electronic communication networks (ECNs). The deeper understanding of the pricing of securities along with the automation of the trading process have changed the role
and nature of traditional exchanges (Di Noia, 2001; Chemmanur and
Fulghieri, 2006), allowed new players to enter ﬁnancial markets (Stoll,
2008), and have generally led to an increase in trading volumes, reduction
in bid ask spreads and the speed at which buy or sell orders are executed.
These developments raise a few questions: What types of ﬁnancial analysis
motivate contemporary trading? How can the large volumes of trading be
explained? Where does trading take place? Each of these questions will be
discussed in the following sections.

INVESTMENT ANALYSIS AND
TYPES OF TRADING
Using a broad classiﬁcation, investment analysis can be performed in two
ways: through fundamental or technical analysis. The goal of this section is
to investigate how various forms of investment analysis motivate or result in
the trading of securities rather than to engage in the debate whether technical analysis is a sound ﬁnancial approach compared with classical analysis
such as fundamental analysis or the identiﬁcation of arbitrage opportunities
(Treynor and Ferguson, 1985; Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron, 1992;
Sullivan, Timmermann, and White, 1999).

Trading Motivated by Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysis is an approach motivated by classical ﬁnance principles of valuation. Here an analyst decides whether a security is over- or
undervalued relative to its fundamental value. If, for example, a security is
undervalued, an agent would buy the securit y and hold it until it has

chapter 27 TR ADING in P r i m a r y a n d S e c o n d a r y M a r k e t s

reached its fair valuation level. This is commonly referred to as a buy-andhold trading strategy.

Arbitrage Motivated Trading
A second motivation for trading is that an agent has identiﬁed an arbitrage
opportunity in the market. This could be the case when a trader knows that
the price of a security differs from its fundamental value (Dow and Gorton,
1994). The agent then decides whether to try to take advantage of the perceived mispricing or to wait and beneﬁt from a potential gain due to additional possible divergence in prices (Kondor, 2009). Most arbitrage
opportunities do not persist in the market and that is the reason for why
electronic trading using sophisticated algorithms is a widely used technique
to exploit short-term mispricing in the market.

Technical Analysis and Technical Trading
In the academic literature technical analysis has received little attention relative to fundamental analysis (Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang, 2000). In contrast,
the practitioner literature provides many illustrations of how technical trading is used in trading by investment institutions. Technical analysis is mostly
based on historical information and does not deal with the estimation or
calculation of expected prices based on a theoretical asset pricing model. It
has been most successfully used in currency markets (Osler, 2003).
The goal of technical analysis is to identify patterns in historical price
and/or volume data (Blume, Easley, and O’Hara, 1994). These patterns
could be used to implement a trading strategy using technical rules (Taylor,
1994). This could be achieved by employing genetic algorithms (Allen and
Karjalainen, 1999; Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang, 2000; Wang, 2000). Some
simple and popular technical trading rules are the moving average and trading break rules such as “head-and-shoulders” or “double-bottoms” (Brock,
Lakonishok, and LeBaron, 1992; Kho, 1996; Zhu and Zhou, 2009). Technical analysis could also be employed by an agent to identify to what extent
new information has been priced into a security (Treynor and Ferguson,
1985; Brown and Jennings, 1989; Grundy and McNichols, 1989). Brunnermeier (2005) shows that informed traders can beneﬁt from technical analysis if they know both past prices and some private information. Such a
private information signal could be imprecise or noisy. Technical analysis

405

could also motivate a trader to pursue a momentum or contrarian trading
strategy (Keim and Madhavan, 1995; Okunev and White, 2003).

Other Motivations for Trading
Trading can also be motivated by noninformation-based reasons. For
example, fund managers adjust portfolio holdings when cash contributions
or withdrawals take place (Keim and Madhavan, 1995). Such situations
could arise due to workplace changes or retirement of fund unit holders.
Cash inﬂows or outﬂows could also be related to good “relative” or poor
“absolute” fund performance (Ikovic and Weisbenner, 2009). Furthermore,
index funds have to trade shares when the constituents of an index change.
Finally, trading could also be induced for tax or seasonalit y reasons
(Poterba and Weisbenner, 2001; Ikovic, Poterba, and Weisbenner, 2005).

COMPOSITION OF TRADING
VOLUME AND TRADING
How can the large increases in trading volumes in primary equity, bond,
or currency markets be explained? Three major trends in the development
of ﬁnancial markets serve as possible explanations: (1) the growth of electronic trading; (2) the emergence of high-frequency trading; and (3) the
level of investor sophistication. These trends have all contributed to the
dramatic increase in trading volumes. Below, these trends are discussed in
more detail.
Over the past 20 years electronic trading has gradually substituted ﬂoor
trading of securities. Simultaneously, the level of investor sophistication has
increased and ﬁnancial markets have witnessed the hiring of people with
nontraditional and nonﬁnancial backgrounds such as engineers, physicists,
mathematicians, and computer scientists. These professionals have not only
been able to employ complex ﬁnancial formulae but also to develop powerful electronic platforms through which they operate sophisticated and often
automated trading algorithms. This combination of skill sets has contributed to the rapid growth of electronic trading.
By 2008, electronic trading accounted for 40 percent of daily trading
volume according to Deutsche Börse (Grant and Gangahar, 2008). In the
U.S. equities markets, according to the Tabb Group, the emergence of

chapter 27 TR ADING in P r i m a r y a n d S e c o n d a r y M a r k e t s

electronic trading has also led to a substantial increase in high-frequency
trading through the use of ﬂash orders amounting to about 73 percent of
daily trading volume (Mackenzie, 2009). Flash orders are high-frequency
orders which are executed within a fraction of a second by using automated trading platforms and algorithms. This practice is most common on
the NASDAQ OMX market and BATS, an ECN, but not encouraged by
the NYSE Euronext exchange.
The popularity of electronic and high-frequency trading has helped
BATS to become the third largest U.S. equit y market behind NYSE
Euronext and NASDAQ. A possible reason for this rapid climb of BATS
could be that ECNs have helped to improve quote quality (Huang, 2002).
Other reasons that have helped ECNs to attract trading, and in particular
informed trading, are greater anonymity and the speed of order execution
(Barclay, Hendershott, and McCormick, 2003). In addition, electronic trading has facilitated the emergence of alternative trading systems such as day
and after-hours crossing systems (Conrad, Johnson, and Wahal, 2003).

TRADING IN PRIMARY VERSUS
SECONDARY MARKETS
Trading is not conﬁned to the primary markets but also takes place in the
secondary or derivatives markets. To implement a trading strategy a trader
might establish long or short positions in the derivatives market rather than
in the underlying security. This approach has the advantage of being less
capital intensive. Options can also play an important role during takeover
attempts. In addition, a trader can combine call and put options to execute a
volatilit y trading strategy. However, the statistics in Lakonishok et al.
(2007) show that the combination of call and put options, such as straddles
and strangles, represent only a small percentage of trading. In contrast, Pan
and Poteshman (2006) show that informed trading represents a signiﬁcant
fraction of option trading and that this can create some predictability about
future stock prices. Table 27.1 provides stock and index option volume and
open interest information for the ﬁrst three quarters of 2008 for all U.S.
listed option contracts. The volume data demonstrate a stark difference in
trading volumes between stock options and index options. Apart from
March 2008 stock call option volumes are always higher than put stock
option volumes. The opposite is true for index options. In each month

more put index options are traded than index call options. A possible explanation for this ﬁnding could be that traders and investors were more concerned about overvaluation at the market level but at the same time were
not too concerned about valuation levels at the individual stock levels.
In other ﬁnancial markets, particularly the bond, currency, and commodities markets, f ut ures contracts are more frequently traded than
options. A major beneﬁt of the futures market is that both long and short
positions can be established easily and cost-effectively. In addition, the
problem of short-sales constraints in the primary market does not arise in
the futures market (Nagel, 2005). Despite this, in the United States short
selling in the equities market by far outweighs trading volumes in short
positions in the secondary SSF market (Shastri, Thirumalai, and Zutter,
2008). The high volumes are illustrated in Diether, Lee, and Werner (2009)
who show that short selling represents approximately a quarter of all NYSE
and 31 percent of NASDAQ transactions.
In contrast, the relatively low volumes in the SSF market are shown in
Tables 27.2 and 27.3. Columns 2 and 3 in Table 27.2 show that in the United
States trading volumes in SSFs have declined markedly in August 2008. This
is one month prior to the dramatic fall in equities markets in September and
October 2008. Column 5 in Table 27.2 shows the corresponding trading
volumes for the NYSE Liffe Universal Stock Futures (USF) market. The
data show a low volume for August but a high volume for September 2009.
Table 27.3 presents OneChicago SSF trading volumes over the period –5 to
5 trading days relative to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy announcement
on September 15, 2008. Although trading volumes fell during and around
the announcement, they increased within a few days.
A possible explanation for the low level of trading in SSF contracts could
be that these contracts were previously banned in the United States due to
the Shad-Johnson Accord and only reintroduced on November 8, 2002 by
the OneChicago and NQLX (a joint venture of NASDAQ and Liffe)
(Shastri, Thirumalai, and Zutter, 2008). The comparison in Table 27.2 of
OneChicago with other markets that trade SSFs shows that only the
London- (UK) based NYSE Liffe market has signiﬁcantly higher volumes
and open interest than OneChicago. SSF volumes on the Hong Kong
Exchange (HKEX) have remained low and the Sydney Futures Exchange
(SFE), a division of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), has delisted SSF
contracts in March 2008 apparently due to low volumes and the emergence
of contracts for difference (CFDs).

CONCLUSION
The volume of trading in ﬁnancial markets has experienced tremendous
growth during the past four decades. This growth was possible due to changes
in the regulatory environment but was mostly driven by the rapid expansion of
electronic trading platforms and the sophisticated use of technical algorithms
which have greatly increased the speed of order execution. So far, equity and
currency markets have experienced the greatest technological changes. Other
ﬁnancial markets, such as bonds, real estate, derivatives, and over-the-counter
markets are developing in response to regulatory calls for increased transparency. Finally, increasingly sophisticated investors require even more efﬁcient and effective platforms for trade execution.

Trading and
Overconﬁdence
Ryan Garvey and Fei Wu

ABSTRACT
Using proprietary data from a U.S. broker-dealer, we test Gervais and
Odean’s (2001) learning model of overconﬁdence in professional stock traders. We ﬁnd that traders place more bets following prior trading gains.
Traders who are most inﬂuenced by their prior trading proﬁts experience
lower performance, but not the lowest. While we ﬁnd a strong link between
prior performance and subsequent trading activity, our results indicate that
the relationship weakens with time. Traders who are active for longer
(shorter) periods of time are less (more) likely to be overconﬁdent.

INTRODUCTION
Theoretical models predict that traders in ﬁnancial markets are overconﬁdent, i.e., they have a tendency to overestimate the precision of their
beliefs or forecasts, and they tend to overestimate their abilities.1 Overconﬁdence is an important issue for traders because traders who are overconﬁdent will lower their performance by entering into suboptimal bets and/or
engaging in too many bets. While ﬁnancial models predict that, on average, traders in ﬁnancial markets are overconﬁdent, there is little empirical
research directly testing the theoretical predictions of overconﬁdence
models on individual traders.2 In our chapter, we test whether or not the
actions of U.S. stock traders are consistent with the learning model of
overconﬁdence developed by Gervais and Odean (2001), hereafter GO

417

418

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

(2001). In GO (2001), overconﬁdence is determined endogeneously and
ﬂuctuates over time as traders learn from their prior experiences. Early on,
when traders are less experienced, they are more likely to overweight the
possibility that their success is due to superior ability. This learning bias
(i.e., self-attribution bias) can cause traders to be overconﬁdent. As traders
gain more experience over time, though, they gain a better understanding
of their abilities, and trader’s level of overconﬁdence subsequently declines.
Using unique data on U.S. stock traders, we ﬁnd empirical evidence supporting three key predictions of the GO (2001) overconﬁdence model.
1. Traders learn from their prior successes and become overconﬁdent.
2. Overconﬁdent traders experience lower performance, though not
necessarily the lowest.
3. Experience matters. Traders become less overconﬁdent over time.
The remainder of our study is organized as follows. First, we describe
the sample data. Next, we provide empirical testing of overconﬁdence theory. Our empirical testing is focused around the GO (2001) learning model
of overconﬁdence. Lastly, we provide concluding remarks.

DATA
The purpose of our study is to empirically examine how traders learn about
their ability and how (if ) a bias in this learning can create overconﬁdent
traders. Such an analysis requires data on traders who are active over an
extended period of time. To satisfy this requirement, we collect sample data
from a U.S. broker-dealer who provides their clients with direct market
access (DMA). Brokers providing DMA services tend to attract more
sophisticated traders because they allow their users to control where and
how their orders are routed for execution. Consequently, they also tend to
attract clients who trade often and in large sizes. A considerable amount of
daily trading activity in U.S. equity markets ﬂows through DMA brokerage
ﬁrms. For example, Goldberg and Lupercio (2004) ﬁnd that approximately
40 percent of NASDAQ and NYSE trading volume is executed by active
traders (25 trades per day) who use U.S. brokers offering DMA services.
We collect data over the sample period October 7, 1999 to August 1,
2003. The ﬁrm mainly attracted clients who had an interest in trading
NASDAQ-listed stocks. This is because NASDAQ stocks trade in multiple

c h a p t e r 2 8 T R A DING A ND O V ERCON F I DEN CE

trading venues and the primary beneﬁt of using a DMA broker is the ability
to route orders to various trading venues. In contrast, NYSE-listed trading
is mainly conﬁned to a single trading location during our sample period.3
Because clients opened an account at our ﬁrm with the primary intent of
beneﬁting their NASDAQ trading, and because a high percentage of trading activity occurs on NASDAQ stocks, our analysis focuses on traders
NASDAQ-listed stock trading. The data are in the form of a transaction
database and provide information such as the identity of the trader, the
time of submission, the time of execution, the market where the order was
sent, the execution size, the execution price(s), the stock symbol, the order
type, the contra party, and various other information concerning the trade
execution (or cancellation) and executing account.
In order to examine traders who are active over an extended period of
time, we ﬁrst restrict our analysis to traders who are active during more
than 250 trading days (approximately one trading year) over the sample
period (969 trading days). We then select accounts that have an intraday
roundtrip match rate exceeding 90 percent. A high intraday match rate is
desirable because it enables us to calculate a robust measure of performance
and ensures that we are examining traders who receive frequent feedback
on their performance. Because we lack opening position data, we cannot
accurately measure performance for traders who engage in longer term
trading strategies. Performance is based on matching up the intraday
trades, using a ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out matching algorithm. For each stock and
trader, we match opening trades with the subsequent closing trade(s) in the
same day. In order to do this, we search forward in time each day until the
opening position is closed out, keeping track of accumulated intraday
inventory and the corresponding prices paid or received.
Table 28.1 provides some summary statistics on the sample data. Overall,
the analysis is based on 109 traders, who combined to execute more than 6
billion shares (3.6 million trades) over the near four-year sample period.
The dollar value traded exceeds $60 billion and the traders managed to
generate over $4 million in trading proﬁts during a bearish market. Our
sample period was considered a very “challenging” market trading environment. For example, the revenues of NASDAQ broker-dealers with a
market-making operation fell over 70 percent during 2000 to 2004 (GAO,
2005). The GAO cited the sharp decline in stock prices, heightened competition, the switch to a smaller tick size, etc., for the sharp decline in trading
revenues during our sample period.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Our empirical results are organized around three key predictions from the
GO (2001) learning model of overconﬁdence. The three hypotheses we test
are as follows.

Hypothesis 1: Past Success Leads to Subsequent Increases in
Trader Activity (i.e., Overconﬁdence)
GO (2001) suggest that trader activity is the primary testable implication of
overconﬁdence theory and that traders increase their activity when they
have experienced prior gains. We empirically test this prediction by estimating a trader ﬁxed-effects regression.4
Log(Sharesi,t)  α i  β1Cum.Prof.i.t  1  Σ Contols  εi,t

(28.1)

Using trader-speciﬁc constant terms, αi is desirable to control for variations across traders. The regression dependent variable Log (Sharesi,t) is the
log number of daily shares traded and the main independent variable of
interest, Cum. Proof .i, t 1 is trader cumulative performance (divided by
$10,000) from the ﬁrst day availabe up to t  1. Because factors other than
past performance might (also) cause traders to increase (decrease) their
activit y, we include several regression control variables that have been
shown in prior ﬁnancial studies to serve as motives for trading. The control

c h a p t e r 2 8 T R A DING A ND O V ERCON F I DEN CE

variables are the log-daily trading volume on NASDAQ, the daily volatility
of NASDAQ, which is measured by the difference in the NASDAQ composite index daily high/low divided by the opening level, the daily (lagged)
return on the NASDAQ composite index, and a dummy variable that takes
the value of 1, or 0 otherwise, if trading occurs at the end of the calendar
year (i.e., December).
Regression results are reported in Table 28.2. The cumulative performance coefﬁcient is positive (0.0113) and highly signiﬁcant (t stat  10.15),
indicating that increases in trader prior performance lead to subsequent
increases in trader activity. This result is consistent with H1. The control
variables reveal the inﬂuence of other factors on trader activity. When daily
volume and price returns are higher, trader activity is also higher. Traders
increase their activity at the end of the year (i.e., December), too. When
price volatility is higher, traders decrease their activity.
The ﬁxed-effects regression dependent variable is trader activity (logdaily number of shares traded). The independent variable include trader
cumulative proﬁt up to time t  1 (1/$10,000), the log-daily trading volume on NASDAQ, the daily volatility of NASDAQ, which is measured by
the difference in the NASDAQ composite index daily high/low divided by
the opening level, the daily (lagged) return on the NASDAQ composite
index, and a dummy variable that takes the value of 1, or 0 otherwise, if
trading occurs in the month of December.

Hypothesis 2: Overconﬁdent Traders Experience Lower
Performance, Though Not Necessarily the Lowest
To test this hypothesis, we ﬁrst conduct individual trader ordinary least
squares regressions using the same regression variables described above
(H1 testing). For example, trader activity is used as the dependent variable
and cumulative performance is used as the main independent variable. The
regressions also use the volume, return, volatility, and year-end controls.
After estimating regressions for each of the 109 traders, we then group
traders into quintiles based on the magnitude of their cumulative performance coefﬁcient. Traders in Q1 have the highest cumulative performance
coefﬁcient (or they are the most overconﬁdent) and traders in Q5 have the
lowest cumulative performance coefﬁcient. Lastly, we compute the mean
total/daily proﬁt (performance) for each group. The results are reported in
Table 28.3.
Traders with high overconﬁdence regression coefﬁcients are, on average,
proﬁtable in a bearish market, yet they underperform Q3 traders, who can
be considered neutral traders. The performance differences are quite large.
For example, the average daily proﬁt of Q3 traders is more than 18 times
higher than Q1 traders and nearly 3 times higher than Q2 traders. The
most overconﬁdent traders underperform the average across all traders,
though they do not have the worst performance. For example, Q5 traders
who are negatively inﬂuenced by their past success perform much worse
than Q1 traders.
Individual ordinary least squares regressions are conducted for each
trader (109) by regressing log-daily number of shares traded on cumulative
proﬁt and controls (see Table 28.2 regression variables). Traders are then
sorted into quintiles based on the magnitude of their cumulative proﬁt

proﬁt are reported for each quintile.

Hypothesis 3: Traders Learn from Trading and
Overconﬁdence Declines Over Time
Gervais and Odean (2001) predict that as traders gain more trading experience, they will also gain a better understanding of their abilities and overconﬁdence will subsequently diminish over time. This can be empirically
tested by including a time effect in our prior regression used to test H1.
We add two more variables to our ﬁxed-effects regression.
Log(Sharesi,t)  α i  β 1 Cum. Prof.i,t 1  β2 Timet  β2
Timet  Cum. Prof.i,t1  Σ Contols  εi,t

(28.2)

The ﬁrst added variable,Timet, measures elapsed calendar time in months
starting at the beginning of our sample period (Time  1 for the ﬁrst
month of our sample period, Time  2 for the second month, etc.). Time is
included in order to separate general effects associated with the passage of
time from time varying (or declining) overconﬁdence. The second added
variable Time t  Cum. Prof. i, t 1 is an interaction term. This is used to
account for the possibility that traders learning bias will dissipate with time
as their experience grows or that cumulative proﬁt will have a declining
inﬂuence on subsequent trader decisions. As predicted by H3, we expect a
negatively signiﬁcant cumulative proﬁt*time coefﬁcient.
The regression results are reported in Model 1 of Panel A, Table 28.4.
Consistent with H3, the cumulative proﬁt*time coefﬁcient is negative
(0.0479) and highly signiﬁcant (t stat  8.03), which suggests that traders
overconﬁdence tendency decreases over time through learning by trading.
In Table 28.4, Panel B, we report the estimated deviations of trader activity
(shares traded) with respect to trader cumulative proﬁts, evaluated for
each period of Time (1 through 46). The deviations steadily decrease and
remain statistically signiﬁcant up to Time 27. This implies that, on average,
traders’ learning bias (or overconﬁdence tendency) runs its course by about
27 months.
The ﬁxed-effects regression dependent variable is trader activity (logdaily number of shares traded). Independent variables include: time, which

measures elapsed calendar time in months starting at the beginning of the
sample period (Time  1 for the ﬁrst sample month, Time  2 for the second month, etc.), trader cumulative proﬁt up to time t – 1 (1/$10,000),

c h a p t e r 2 8 T R A DING A ND O V ERCON F I DEN CE

dummy variable Dactive trader takes the value of 1, or 0 otherwise, if an observation is associated with an active trader (top 30 percent based on total
number of trades), the log-daily trading volume on NASDAQ, the daily
volatility of NASDAQ, which is measured by the difference in the NASDAQ composite index daily high/low divided by the opening level, the
daily (lagged) return on the NASDAQ composite index, and a dummy
variable that takes the value of 1, or 0 otherwise, if trading occurs in the
month of December. Panel B. (Model 1) shows the estimated deviations of
shares traded with respect to cumulative proﬁt, evaluated at various values
of time.
If traders learn from their experiences and overconﬁdence diminishes
with time, then traders who receive feedback about their ability more often
(i.e., more active traders) should learn faster and overconﬁdence should
decline more rapidly with these traders. We test this hypothesis by ﬁrst
identifying the most active traders in our sample data. If traders are in the
top 30 percent based on number of trades, we consider them to be the most
active. We rerun the regression testing Hypothesis 3, including an additional variable (Cumulative Proﬁt*Time* D1(active trader)). The dummy variable
Dactive trader takes the value of 1, or 0 otherwise, if an observation is associated with an active trader. The results are reported in Model 2 of Panel A,
Table 28.4. They indicate that the most active traders learn faster and that
overconﬁdence declines more rapidly with these traders. For example,
trader overconﬁdence (Cumulative Proﬁt*Time) declines 0.0497 over time
for average traders, but 0.3122 (0.0497 to 0.2625) for active traders
(Cumulative Proﬁt*Time* D1(active trader)), holding all other variables constant.
The decline in overconﬁdence among the most active traders is six times
greater than normal.

CONCLUSION
Prior research indicates that overconﬁdence is greatest for difﬁcult tasks,
for forecasts with low predictability, and for undertaking lacking fast clear
feedback.5 This suggests, then, that overconﬁdence is likely to ﬂourish in
trading settings. For example, trading proﬁtably in competitive securities
markets is a difﬁcult task. Future price changes are hard to predict and distinguishing trading skill from luck takes time. Understanding overconﬁdence is important for traders because overconﬁdent traders are likely to
lower their returns by making poor bets and/or engaging in too many bets.

Despite a widespread belief among many that trader’s in ﬁnancial markets are, on average, overconﬁdent there remains little empirical support for
such a belief. In our chapter, we empirically test the predictions of overconﬁdence theory using data on professional traders. Our analysis focuses on
testing the learning model of overconﬁdence developed by Gervais and
Odean (2001). In GO (2001), traders are more likely to be overconﬁdent
when they are relatively inexperienced. Early on, a trader is likely to take
too much credit for his successes as he attempts to recognize his own abilities. With more experience, though, traders become better able to assess
their abilities and overconﬁdence diminishes. GO (2001) note that overconﬁdent traders will experience lower performance, though not necessarily
the lowest.
Using proprietary data from a U.S. broker-dealer, we ﬁnd that professional stock traders increase their activity following prior trading gains.
Traders who are most inﬂuenced by their prior trading proﬁts experience
lower proﬁts, but not the lowest. Although a strong link exists between
prior performance and subsequent trading activity, our results indicate that
the relationship weakens with time. Traders who are active for longer
(shorter) periods of time are less (more) likely to be overconﬁdent.
While our ﬁndings provide empirical support for overconﬁdence theory,
our analysis is based on professional traders at one U.S. broker-dealer.
Whether or not these results hold for traders at other broker-dealers, or
among other types of market participants (mutual fund managers, hedge
fund managers, etc.), are interesting questions for future research.

Correlated Asset
Trading and
Disclosure
of Private
Information
Ariadna Dumitrescu

ABSTRACT
This chapter studies the trading behavior of informed and uninformed
traders in an environment with t wo correlated assets. In this set up,
informed traders receive a signal about the liquidation value of an asset that
also conveys information about the other asset. I extend Kyle’s (1985)
model to a multi-asset market and show that public disclosure of information about one asset affects the trading behavior and market performance
both in the market of this asset and the market of the correlated asset.

INTRODUCTION
The information ﬁrms disclose about their own business can be valuable
information about the performance of all the ﬁrms in the industry. Since the
returns of the ﬁrms in the same industry are correlated, the disclosure of
information about a speciﬁc ﬁrm can provide information about the others.
Hence the disclosure of information reduces the asymmetry of information

429

430

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

not only in the market where this disclosure takes place, but also in the markets of correlated assets. Moreover, the existence of markets of correlated
assets increases the value of acquiring information because insiders can use
their informational advantage when trading different correlated assets.
In this chapter, I develop a strategic trading model where I consider the
existence of two ﬁrms with correlated liquidation values and I study how
the disclosure of information about the liquidation value of one of the ﬁrms
affects the market liquidity of the shares of both ﬁrms. I analyze the optimal strategies of the managers of the two ﬁrms who have private information about the payoff of their ﬁrm and the pricing strategy of the market
maker. I model the interactions between managers as insiders and market
makers, as in Kyle (1985). Both the managers and the noise traders submit
market orders and the market maker sets the price to clear the market.
However the information structure in my model is different. One of the
ﬁrms discloses information about the realization of the ﬁrm’s payoff and
this reduces the asymmetry of information between managers and noise
traders. However, since the ﬁrms have correlated payoffs, the information
disclosed about the liquidation value of one asset can be used also in the
other market to reduce the asymmetry of information. Consequently, my
model shows that the performance of a ﬁrm in the ﬁnancial markets might
be determined by the actions of other ﬁrms in the same industry.
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: the second section of
this chapter provides a review of literature while the third section presents
the model. I establish the information structure and characterize the equilibrium: a unique equilibrium in which price functions and managers’
demands are linear. This chapter’s fourth section studies the impact of disclosure of information on market liquidity. Finally, the ﬁfth section of this
chapter summarizes the results.

Literature Review
This chapter brings together two lines of research: the literature about multiasset security markets and the literature that studies the effect of information
disclosure by ﬁrms. The literature concerned with multi-security markets
starts with the work of Admati (1985) who extends Grossman and Stiglitz’s
(1980) analysis of endogenous information acquisition to multiple assets and
shows how individuals face different risk-return tradeoffs when differential

chapter 29 CORR EL ATED A SSET TR ADING A ND PR IVATE I n f o r m at i o n

information is not fully revealed in equilibrium. Thus in Admati (1985), since
agents submit multi-asset demand schedules conditioning on the prices of all
assets, it is therefore possible to have a price that decreases with the liquidation value of the asset. This is due to the fact that agents use various signals
that are correlated, hence the direct effects can be dominated by the indirect
effects.
Subrahmanyam (1991) considers a multi-asset model where strategic
liquidity traders can choose the market in which they execute their trades.
He shows that the adverse selection problem of liquidity traders is reduced
if they trade in a security index basket as opposed to trading a single security. The outcome is a liquidity-based explanation of the large use of stock
index futures. Similarly, Bhushan (1991) also considers a multi-asset setup
to examine cross-sectional variation in trading costs and liquidity and shows
that liquidity traders diversify their trading across assets. A similar setup,
where assets are correlated is considered by Chan (1993). In his model, one
of the market makers observes only the order ﬂow of the asset for which he
sets the price. He does not observe the order ﬂows in other markets but
deduces information about these order ﬂows from the prices set by other
market makers.
In the papers mentioned above, traders ignore the effect their trade has
both on prices and other traders’ strategies. To account for the impact of
their trading, Caballé and Krishnan (1994) consider a setup with multiple
traders and multiple correlated assets, but unlike Admati (1985), they allow
for the strategic behavior of traders. They extend thus the model of Kyle
(1985) to a multi-asset framework. The market makers in their model can
glean information from the order ﬂows of the other assets and use this
information strategically when setting prices. They extrapolate the result of
Kyle (1985) that more noise leads to more aggressive trading and show that
portfolio diversiﬁcation arises in their model due to the strategic behavior
of the agents and not because of risk considerations.
Pasquariello and Vega (2009) extend Caballé and Krishnan (1994) by
allowing for the release of news about fundamental values and they found
also empirical evidence for cross-asset informational effects. In addition,
Bernhardt and Taub (2008) develop a multi-asset model where underlying
asset values are correlated and show that, if correlated, the profits of
informed speculators are lower. They study how the information contained
in the prices of assets is used by speculators and market makers to trade and

431

432

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

set up the prices of the assets. Their model extends the model of Admati
(1985) along the lines of Kyle (1989) in the sense that traders behave strategically and choose their demand conditioning on prices too.
Other papers have extended the previous models to a dynamic setting
with multiple risky assets. Thus, the model of Bernhardt and Taub (2008) is
extended by Seiler and Taub (2008), who answer a similar question but in a
dynamic setting. The dynamic modeling allows them to show how this
cross-asset information evolves dynamically over time. Zhou (1998) also
extends in a dynamic setting the model of Admati (1985) and studies portfolio choices in a multi-asset securities market with differential information.
He shows that the information structure has a signiﬁcant impact both on
asset prices and portfolio choices.
Another group of models addressing a multi-asset setup are the studies
concerned with contagion among ﬁnancial markets—the propagation of a
shock to an asset to other unrelated assets. Some of these papers have
focused on contagion through correlated information or a correlated liquidity shock channel. The correlated liquidity shock channel assumes that
when some market participants need to liquidate some of their assets, they
choose to liquidate assets in a number of markets, effectively transmitting
the shock. There are several other alternative explanations for contagion:
wealth effects (Kyle and Xiong, 2001), portfolio rebalancing (Kodres and
Pritsker, 2002), borrowing constraints (Yuan, 2005), and the heterogeneity
of insiders’ beliefs and strategic portfolio rebalancing (Pasquariello, 2007).
Finally, Pagano (1989), Chowdhry and Nanda (1991), Huddart, Hughes,
and Brunnermeier (1999), and Baruch, Karolyi, and Lemmon (2007) examine the distribution of trades between different marketplaces. Pagano (1989)
focuses on the role of traders’ expectations of other traders’ actions and
show that both markets can survive only with a certain exchange design
(equal transaction costs and equal numbers of traders in each market).
Chowdhry and Nanda (1991) allow for both discretionary and nondiscretionary liquidity trading, and show that informed and uninformed trades
concentrate in markets with more stringent disclosure policies. Similarly,
Huddart, Hughes, and Brunnermeier (1999) show that insiders always
choose to list their company on the stock exchange with the highest disclosure requirement in order to beneﬁt from the presence of the discretionary
liquidity traders. Baruch, Karolyi, and Lemmon (2007) develop a model to
explain the differences in the foreign share of the trading volume of internationally cross-listed stocks and show that the trading volume of a cross-listed

chapter 29 CORR EL ATED A SSET TR ADING A ND PR IVATE I n f o r m at i o n

stock is proportionally higher on the exchange in which asset returns are
more correlated to the returns of other assets traded on that market.
On the other hand, this chapter is linked to the stream of literature
about the disclosure of information by ﬁrms. The disclosure of private
information transforms private information into public information and as a
result, the asymmetry of information between market participants is
reduced. Diamond (1985) develops a model in which he shows that the disclosure of information improves welfare because it eliminates the costs of
information acquisition. Disclosure of information helps firms attract
investors because it reduces the asymmetry of information and therefore
reduces the cost of capital. Diamond and Verrecchia (1991) and Kim and
Verrecchia (1994) show that voluntary disclosure reduces the asymmetry of
information bet ween uninformed and informed investors, and thus
increases the liquidity of a ﬁrm’s stock. Similarly, Botosan (1997) shows
that there is a negative relationship between the voluntary level of disclosure and the cost of capital when there is a low analyst following.
Firms that want to disclose information face the problem that truthful
credible disclosure is costly, so they have to take into account these costs when
they take their disclosure decision. To exemplify this, Verrechia (1983) develops a model where the seller of an asset has to decide whether to reveal or
conceal information about the asset. Revealing information is costly but concealing it can be perceived as a bad signal by investors who then bid low prices
for the asset. Narayanan (2000) extends Verrechia’s (1983) model by endogenizing the disclosure costs by allowing the seller of the asset to trade upon his
private information. Also, Fishman and Hagerty (1989) show that ﬁrms have
incentives to disclose a certain amount of information but they claim that
mandatory disclosure is not socially optimal since the beneﬁts outweigh the
costs. Admati and Pﬂeiderer (1990) examine the sale of ﬁnancial information
and demonstrate that externalities between buyers affect the value of information and how broadly a given packet of information should be sold.

THE MODEL
I consider an economy with two ﬁrms in the same industry, so their liquidation values are correlated. Shares in the two ﬁrms are both traded on the
ﬁnancial market. We assume that the ﬁrst ﬁrm has a project with liquidation
value ~
v1  ~
v that is normally distributed with mean v– and variance Vv and the
v~
e, where ~
e is normally distributed with
second ﬁrm has a project ~
v2  ~

433

434

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

mean 0 and variance Ve. Consequently, the second ﬁrm’s payoff is normally
distributed with mean ~
v and variance Vv  Ve.
Both managers learn the realization of the payoff of their ﬁrms and make
use of their private information by trading the shares of both ﬁrms in the
two ﬁnancial markets. I denote by Mi the manager of the ﬁrm i, i  1, 2.
The market participants in each of the two markets are, therefore, two
informed traders—the two managers, some noise traders, and a market
maker. I assume that noise traders’ order in the market for the shares of ﬁrm
j, ω j is a random variable normally distributed with mean 0 and variance Vω j,
with j  1, 2. The market maker in the market for the shares of ﬁrm j
observes the total order ﬂow and sets a price pj for the ﬁrm j’s shares.
The sequence of events is as follows:
1. The ﬁrms’ payoffs ~
v1 and ~
v2 are realized and observed privately by
the manager of each ﬁrm, respectively.
2. Firm 1 discloses information about asset 1, ~s  ~
v  ε~, where ε, is a
1

random variable normally distributed with mean 0 and variance Vε.
3. The manager Mi, i  1, 2, submits an order xij for shares in the ﬁrm j,
j  1, 2 to a market maker who is in charge of setting the price in the
stock market.
4. The market maker in the market for asset j observes the total order
ﬂow u j  x1j  x2j  ωj consisting of the managers’ orders x1j and x2j
and the order made by noise traders ωj but cannot observe x1j, x2j or ωj
individually. Upon observing the total order ﬂow, the market maker
sets a price pj for the ﬁrm j’s shares and trading takes place.
The pricing rules for the market maker and the trading strategies for
informed traders are such that each trader takes the trading strategies of all
the other traders and the pricing rules of the market makers as given. Each
informed trader maximizes his expected proﬁt from trading conditional on
his information and each market maker earns zero expected proﬁts. Thus,
the demand of the manager Mi for asset j is as follows:
E ((vj  pj) x ij|vi, s), i, j  1, 2.
xij  arg max

We assume that in each ﬁnancial market there is a market maker who
sets the price such that to satisfy the semi-strong efﬁciency condition

The Equilibrium
In the following proposition, I describe the equations that characterize
the symmetric Bayesian-Nash equilibrium. This equilibrium has linear
trading and pricing rules and is shown to be unique among all linear,
symmetric Bayesian-Nash equilibria. As in most Kyle-t ype models,
linearities are not imposed beforehand in the agent’s strategy sets: as long
as informed traders use linear trading strategies, the pricing rule will be
linear and vice versa.
Proposition 1: There is a unique linear equilibrium in the market of asset 1,
where the demands of the managers and the equilibrium price are
• x11 ( v1 , s ) =

Notice that manager Mi trades twice as aggressively on the information
revealed by the public signal s in the market for shares in his own ﬁrm than
in the market where shares in the other ﬁrm are traded. Moreover, in the
market for asset j the demand of manager M i decreases with the signal
about the liquidation value of ﬁrm s, when i  j while the demand for the
shares of the other ﬁrm increases with the signal, when i
j. When some
information is disclosed, the manager weighs his private signal against the
public signal when he trades in his own market. However, when manager
Mi trades in the market of the shares in the other ﬁrm j he uses the signal
about the liquidation value of asset 1 as a signal about the liquidation value
of asset j, thereby weighs the signal positively.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
AND MARKET LIQUIDITY
I study next the effects of releasing information about the payoff of one
asset on the market performance of both assets. I limit my study of market
performance only in terms of market liquidity since it is recognized as the
most important characteristic of ﬁnancial markets. To measure market liquidity I use market depth as deﬁned by Kyle (1985): the volume needed to
move the price by one unit.
The price schedules deﬁned in Proposition 1 show that the volume
1
needed to move the price pj by one unit is — . In ﬁnding the equilibrium, I

solve for λj and I obtain that market depths in the two markets equal to

I will ﬁrstly analyze the impact of the disclosure of information on the market liquidity of the two markets. Therefore, in the case of both markets
I consider the economy with and without the disclosure of private information. To obtain the case without disclosure I calculate the limit when the

variance of the signal becomes very large. In this case the signal provides
no information, so the managers use only their own private signals in setting the demand schedules.
As can be seen in Figure 29.1, I show that disclosing information about one
asset improves the market liquidity in both markets. As expected, the disclosure of information reduces the asymmetry of information between market
makers and informed traders. Consequently, the adverse selection problem of
the market maker is less severe and therefore disclosure of information
improves market liquidity. Since the two assets are correlated, the disclosure of
information in the market of asset 1 affects the liquidity of the market of asset
2. The effect disclosing private information has on market liquidity depends
not only on the asymmetry of information between managers and noise traders but also on the quality of the signal about the liquidation value of ﬁrm 1.

437

Proposition 2: Market liquidity is higher in the market of asset 1 than the
market liquidity of asset 2 if and only if

I compare market liquidity in the two markets and show that the market
of asset 1 is more liquid if the ratio of the amount of noise in market 1 to
the amount of noise in market 2 is sufﬁciently high. This suggests that
when ﬁrm 1 releases information about the liquidation of value of their
shares, this reduces the asymmetry of information and therefore improves
market liquidity in this market. However, the disclosure of information in
the market of the ﬁrst asset also reduces the asymmetry of information in
the second market and therefore also increases market liquidity in the second market.
Should the ﬁrst ﬁrm not disclose information, the market liquidity of
each market will depend only on the asymmetry of information between
managers and noise traders. When the ﬁrst ﬁrm discloses information
about its liquidation value it affects this asymmetry of information between
managers and noise traders. This effect depends on the quality of the signal
about the liquidation value of the asset (i.e., on the variance of the noise
introduced by the ﬁrm), but it is not the same in the two markets and for
the two managers.
In the market of asset 1, the lower the variance of the signal’s noise Vε
the lower the asymmetry of information about the liquidation value of the
asset between manager M1 and the noise traders. So the higher disclosure
decreases the informational advantage of ﬁrst manager M1. However, manager M2 improves his informational advantage. He had private information
about the liquidation value of asset 2 (and since the assets are correlated he
could use it as private information about asset 1), but now he can also use
the information disclosed by ﬁrm 1. So the quality of his private information improves. In the market of asset 2, the effects are similar. However, the
effect of a reduction in the asymmetry of information between manager
M2 and the noise traders caused by the disclosure of information about the
liquidation value of asset 1 is now not so strong. The reason is that the signal s as a signal about the liquidation value of asset 2 is noisier than when
we use it as a signal about the liquidation value of asset 1. Also, manager M1

uses the signal s as a signal about the liquidation value of asset 2, but in this
case too the quality of this signal is poorer.
As can be seen in Figure 29.2, the increase in market liquidity as a
result of the release of a public signal about the liquidation value of the
asset can be higher either in market 1 or in market 2, depending on the
amount of the noise trading in the two markets and on the asymmetry of
information about the liquidation values of the two assets. The increase in
liquidity in market 1 is higher only if the amount of noise trading in market 2 is relatively small in comparison with the amount of noise trading in
market 1. As can be seen in Figure 29.2, when all other things are equal,
the asymmetry of information about the liquidation value of the asset
determines whether the impact of disclosure of information is higher in
the market where the signal is disclosed or in the other market. When the

439

440

PA RT V T R A DING V OL U M E A ND B E H AV IOR

asymmetry of the liquidation value is low in both markets (Vv is low) and
there is not too much noise trading, the increase in liquidity after disclosure is higher in the ﬁrst market. As asymmetry climbs above a given
threshold, the increase in liquidity becomes higher in the second market.
This result is a consequence of the relative asymmetry of information of
the managers with respect to the noise traders.

CONCLUSION
I study the effect the disclosure of information in one market has on the
market performance in the markets of correlated assets. I develop a twoasset model similar to Kyle (1985) and I show that the disclosure of a signal about the liquidation value of one asset affects the market liquidity of
both the market in which this asset is traded and the market in which a
correlated asset is traded. Disclosure of information increases market
liquidity in both markets, but the impact of disclosure in the two markets
depends on the relative amount of noise trading, the variance of the liquidation values of the two assets, and the quality of the signal about the
liquidation value.
